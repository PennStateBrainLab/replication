Not all neuronal damage occurs at the time of primary injury, but rather TBI initiates a cascade of events that leads to secondary brain injury. Oxygenation is one crucial factor in maintaining brain tissue homeostasis post-injury. We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to a single trauma center after TBI. Statistical analysis was performed to ascertain if the measured partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) affected overall outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital. Materials and Methods Statistical analysis was performed retrospectively on patients admitted with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 8 and a diagnosis of TBI. GCS and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were calculated from physical examination findings at the time of hospital discharge or death. Patient data were separated into two groups: those with consistently higher average PaO2 scores (>= 150 mmHg; n = 7) and those with lower average PaO2 scores (< 150 mmHg; n = 8). The minimum requirement to be categorized in the consistently higher group was to have an average hospital day 1 through 5 PaO2 value of >= 150 mmHg. Results Patients with consistent hospital Day 1 through 5 PaO2 scores of >= 150 mmHg had statistically significant higher GCS scores at the end of intensive care unit (ICU)-level care or hospital discharge (mean = 12, p = 0.01), compared to those in group 2 with lower PaO2 levels (mean = 7.9). There was no statistically significant difference in GOS when comparing the two groups (p = 0.055); however, the data did show a trend toward significance. Discussion and Conclusion In our study we analyzed patients diagnosed with TBI and stratified them into groups based on PaO2 >= or < 150 mmHg. We demonstrate overall outcome improvement based on GCS with a trend toward improved GOS. The GCS showed statistical significance in patients with PaO2 consistently >= 150 mmHg versus those in group 2 over the first five days of hospitalization.

In Vivo Assessment of Cell Death and Nigrostriatal Pathway Integrity Following Continuous Expression of C3 Transferase	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						RhoA; C3 transferase; dopaminergic neurons; tyrosine hydroxylase; Cre recombinase; rodent behavior	GENE-THERAPY; PARKINSON DISEASE; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; AXON GROWTH; RHO; NEURONS; INACTIVATION; APOPTOSIS; GTPASE; INJURY	The bacterial exoenzyme C3 transferase (C3) irreversibly inhibits RhoA GTPase leading to stimulation of axonal outgrowth in injured neurons. C3 has been used successfully in models of neurotrauma and shows pro-mise as an option to support cell survival and axonal growth of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in Parkinson's dis-ease (PD) cell therapy. Whether the continuous expression of C3 in DA neurons is well-tolerated is unknown. To assess the potential neurotoxicity of sustained expression of C3 in DA neurons, we generated Cre recombinase-dependent adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) for targeted C3 delivery to DA neurons of the mouse substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The effect of continuous expression of C3 on DA neurons was assessed by immunohistochemistry and compared to that of Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) as negative controls. We did not find significant reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression levels nor the presence of cleaved activated caspase 3. Astrocytic activation as determined by GFAP expression was compara-ble to EYFP controls. To evaluate the impact of C3 expression on striatal terminals of the nigrostriatal pathway, we compared the rotational behavior of wildtype mice injected unilaterally with either C3 or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Mice injected with C3 exhibited similar ipsiversive rotations to the site of injection in comparison to con-trol mice injected with EYFP and significantly fewer ipsiversive rotations compared to 6-OHDA lesioned mice. Non-significant difference between C3 and EYFP controls in behavioral and histological analyses demonstrate that transduced DA neurons express C3 continuously without apparent adverse effects, supporting the use of C3 in efficacy studies targeting DA neurons.

Neurosurgical patients admitted via the emergency department initiating comfort care measures: a prospective cohort analysis	ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA			English	Article						Comfort care; Emergency department; Emergent surgery; End-of-life care; Hospital admission; Stroke	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PALLIATIVE CARE; LIFE; END; NEUROONCOLOGY; DEATH; THROMBECTOMY; PROGNOSIS; STROKE; TUMORS	Background Given the serious nature of many neurosurgical pathologies, it is common for hospitalized patients to elect comfort care (CC) over aggressive treatment. Few studies have evaluated the incidence and risk factors of CC trends in patients admitted for neurosurgical emergencies. Objectives To analyze all neurosurgical patients admitted to a tertiary care academic referral center via the emergency department (ED) to determine incidence and characteristics of those who initiated CC measures during their initial hospital admission. Methods We performed a prospective, cohort analysis of all consecutive adult patients admitted to the neurosurgical service via the ED between October 2018 and May 2019. The primary outcome was the initiation of CC measures during the patient's hospital admission. CC was defined as cessation of life-sustaining measures and a shift in focus to maintaining the comfort and dignity of the patient. Results Of the 428 patients admitted during the 7-month period, 29 (6.8%) initiated CC measures within 4.0 +/- 4.0 days of admission. Patients who entered CC were significantly more likely to have a medical history of cerebrovascular disease (58.6% vs. 33.3%,p = 0.006), dementia (17.2% vs. 1.5%,p = 0.0004), or cancer with metastatic disease (24.1% vs. 7.0%,p = 0.001). Patients with a presenting pathology associated with cerebrovascular disease were significantly more likely to initiate CC (62.1% vs. 35.3,p = 0.04). Patients who underwent emergent surgery were significantly more likely to enter CC compared with those who had elective surgery (80.0% vs. 42.7%,p = 0.02). Only 10 of the 29 (34.5%) patients who initiated CC underwent a neurosurgical operation(p = 0.002). Twenty of the 29 (69.0%) patients died within 0.8 +/- 0.8 days after the initiation of CC measures. Conclusion CC measures were initiated in 6.8% of patients admitted to the neurosurgical service via the ED, with the majority of patients entering CC before an operation and presenting with a cerebrovascular pathology.

James			Thromboelastography to Assess Coagulopathy in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia	THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; thromboelastography; coagulation; hypothermia	MORTALITY; THROMBELASTOGRAPHY; FIBRINOLYSIS; TEMPERATURE	Therapeutic hypothermia has been a treatment option for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) for many years. There has, however, been uncertainty whether hypothermia in this context also increased clinical bleeding risk, perhaps due to platelet dysfunction. Standard coagulation tests do not allow accurate assessment ofin vivocoagulation. We studied specific coagulation abnormalities in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for severe TBI using bedside thromboelastography (TEG).We studied 20 patients with severe blunt TBI from a single tertiary ICU who were enrolled in the prophylactic hypothermia to lessen traumatic brain injury (POLAR) trial. Ten patients had been randomized to hypothermia, and 10 were controls receiving normothermic standard care. TEG was undertaken during and after therapeutic hypothermia, and at the same time points in controls. Coagulation profiles were then compared between the hypothermic and control patients, and also between hypothermia and later normothermia in the study patients. Patients were primarily young (mean age 34 years) and male (85%). Measures of injury severity, including Glasgow coma score and injury severity scale, were not different between groups. Using TEG, the median alpha angle was reduced in hypothermic patients compared with controls (69.2 degrees vs. 72.0 degrees,p = 0.02), although both were within the normal range. LY30 was also reduced (0.0% vs. 0.5%,p < 0.01). Both differences persisted when hypothermic patients were compared with themselves during later normothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia during severe TBI causes a small decrease in the rate of clot formation. However, this decrease is within the normal range, and is unlikely to be clinically significant.

J	Campolettano, ET; Rowson, S				Campolettano, Eamon T.; Rowson, Steven			Relating on-field youth football head impacts to pneumatic ram laboratory testing procedures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Head acceleration; helmet standards; impact testing	CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; EXPOSURE; CONCUSSION; SCHOOL; ACCELERATION; KINEMATICS; MAGNITUDE; PLAYERS; INJURY	A youth-specific football helmet testing standard has been proposed to address the physical and biomechanical differences between adult and youth football players. This study sought to relate the proposed youth standard-defined laboratory impacts to on-field head impacts collected from youth football players. Head impact data from 112 youth football players (ages 9-14) were collected through the use of helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays. These head impacts were filtered to only include those that resided in corridors near prescribed National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) impact locations. Peak linear head acceleration and peak rotational head acceleration magnitudes collected from pneumatic ram impactor tests as specified by the proposed NOCSAE youth standard were compared to the distribution of on-field head impacts. All laboratory impact tests were among the top 10% in terms of magnitude for Severity Index and peak rotational acceleration of matched location head impacts experienced by youth football players. As concussive head impacts are among the most severe impacts experienced on the field, a safety standard geared toward mitigating concussion should assess the most severe on-field head impacts. This proposed testing standard may be refined as more becomes known regarding the biomechanics of concussion among youth athletes.

J	Chandra, VVR; Bodapati, CMP; Paradesi, R				Chandra, Ramesh V. V.; Bodapati, Chandra Mowliswara Prasad; Paradesi, Rajesh			Role of Intraoperative ICP And CPP Measurement for Predicting Surgical Outcome in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury	INDIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						ICP-Intracranial pressure; CPP-Cerebral perfusion pressure; GOS-Glasgow outcome scale; ROC-receiver-operating characteristic	CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY; MANAGEMENT; OXYGEN	Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide, and optimizing the management of these patients is a continuing challenge. Intraoperative intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were evaluated for use as prognostic indicators after surgery for severe TBI. Although ICP and CPP monitoring is standard postsurgery treatment for TBI, very few studies have reported the use of ICP and CPP values monitored during surgery. Objectives The objectives of this study were to evaluate the use of intraoperative ICP and CPP values as prognostic indicators and as subjective guidelines for managing severe TBI. Materials and methods All patients with severe TBI who underwent surgical decompression and ICP monitoring intraoperatively were included in our study from 2017 to 2018. We measured ICP and CPP values after creation of the first burr hole, after hematoma evacuation, and after wound closure. Results From the analysis of receiver-operated characteristic (ROC) curves, we observed that ICP initial (cutoff > 28 mm Hg) and CPP initial (cutoff < 44.5 mm Hg) are the best predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Favorable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale [GOS] 4 and 5) and unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-3) after 6 months were achieved in 64.1 and 35.8% of patients, respectively. There was significant difference between the ICP and CPP values which are measured after the first burrhole, after hematoma evacuation, and after scalp closure in both favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The highest positive Pearson's correlation coefficient is found between GOS and ICP and CPP after first burr hole. Conclusion Monitoring ICP and CPP during surgery improves management in patients with severe TBI and provides an early prognostic indicator in such patients.	[Chandra, Ramesh V.

Studies in rats have shown alterations in intestinal mucosa to correlate with severity and duration of TBI. There is lack of such evidence in humans. So we intended to find correlation between histopathological changes and expression of aquaporin 4 (AQ4) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in jejunal mucosa in post TBI patients. Methodology Autopsy specimens of jejunum were obtained from patients who had died due to TBI (n = 20), patients dying due to traumatic injury other than TBI, and patients who were brought dead (diseased controls n = 20). Abdominal trauma was the exclusion criterion for both. Jejunal specimens were grossly examined and then analyzed histopathologically and graded immunohistochemically for AQ4 and NPY. Unpairedt-test was used to compare results. Results After exclusion, 19 cases and 17 controls were studied. No significant difference was observed in the microscopic findings between cases and controls (p-value = 0.70). The expression of AQ4 was more in cases (p-value = 0.04). NPY expression was not significantly different (p-value = 0.93). Conclusion AQ4 can hence be used as a marker of GI injury post TBI. Histopathological examination cannot distinguish between these changes.

Epidemiological studies are needed to obtain current information and provide appropriate service planning. This study aimed to clarify the current prevalence and subtype distribution of EOD, as well as the services frequently used by individuals with EOD. Methods A multisite, population-based, two-step study was conducted. Questionnaires were sent to 26 416 candidate facilities in 12 areas with a target population of 11 630 322 to inquire whether any individuals with EOD had sought services or stayed during the last 12 months (step 1). When "yes" responses were received, additional questionnaires were sent to the facilities both to complete and to distribute to the target individuals with EOD to obtain more detailed information, including the dementia subtype (step 2). Results In step 1, valid responses were obtained from 16 848 facilities (63.8%), and 4077 cases were identified. In step 2, detailed information was obtained for 1614 cases (39.6%) from the facilities and 530 cases (13.0%) from the individuals. The national EOD prevalence rate was estimated to be 50.9/100 000 population at risk (95% confidence interval: 43.9-57.9; age range, 18-64 years). The number of individuals with EOD was estimated to be 35 700 as of 2018. Alzheimer-type dementia (52.6%) was the most frequent subtype, followed by vascular dementia (17.1%), frontotemporal dementia (9.4%), dementia due to traumatic brain injury (4.2%), dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia (4.1%), and dementia due to alcohol-related disorders (2.8%). Individuals with EOD were most frequently identified at medical centers for dementia. Conclusion The prevalence rate estimated in this study was comparable to those in previous studies in Japan. However, the subtype distribution differed, with Alzheimer-type dementia being the most prominent. Based on the case identification frequencies, medical centers for dementia are expected to continue to function as the primary special health service by providing quality diagnosis and post-diagnostic support for individuals with EOD.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of hospital admission following a fall among New South Wales (NSW) infants and changes in admission rate over time. Secondary aims were to examine demographics, nature of injury and trends by age groups associated with developmental milestones and fall mechanism. Methods This was a retrospective, population-based study across NSW from 2002 to 2013 using the NSW Admitted Patient Data collection. Infants with recorded falls, external causes of morbidity and mortality and activity codes were assessed. Main outcome measures were absolute numbers, rates and proportions by year, age group, socio-demographics, fall mechanism, injury type, body region affected and admission outcome. Results A total of 4380 cases were identified. Numbers increased over years (342 in 2002 to 469 in 2013). Rate of admissions per 10 000 population were 40.37 in 2002 and 47.18 in 2013 (average increase 0.9% per year,P= 0.25). 76% resided in a major city, 23% resided in the least disadvantaged areas and 18% in the most disadvantaged. Falls from furniture and falls while being carried were most common. 85% suffered a head injury, 70% of which had a traumatic brain injury (TBI). There were seven deaths and one quarter of surviving infants were admitted for 2 or more days. Conclusions Hospital admission following a fall is a long-standing problem with no improvement among infants in NSW, commonly leading to head injury and traumatic brain injury. Effective prevention interventions are needed.

Dizziness and imbalance are two common symptoms in mild TBI (mTBI). In about 10-15% of TBI patients, these symptoms remain for a long time and may show no recovery. These persistent symptoms may relate to different factors including vestibular abnormalities. The aim of this study is a vestibular assessment of patients with persistent symptoms of mTBI by different tests including computerized dynamic posturography. Materials and Methods 21 patients with mTBI evaluated in this study. Patients were civilians with persistent symptoms. TBI did cause by blunt force trauma (mainly from falling) in the past 6 months. They had normal neurologic and musculoskeletal assessments and no temporal bone fracture. Several auditory and vestibular evaluations were performed for each patient. They included: case history, otoscopy, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, vestibular bedside examination (spontaneous nystagmus, gaze, saccade, pursuit, Dix-Hallpike maneuver, side-lying maneuver, roll, and Romberg test), cervical Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (c-VEMP), Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Results Patients showed hearing loss in 10 (47.6%) and tinnitus in 4 (19.0%) cases. In ocular motor tests, patients had the most abnormal results in the pursuit test. 6 patients also had Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) in the posterior canal. c-VEMP showed abnormal saccular function in 14 patients. In CDP, the composite scores were decreased relative to normal populations. Conclusion vestibular tests showed abnormal results in most patients. Vestibular abnormality could relate to persisting symptoms of mTBI patients.

Re It was not clear how and whether neural stem cells (NSCs) responded to toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the inflammatory environment after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The current study investigated the correlation of TLR2 and NSC proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) using the TBI model of rats. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to observe the expression of BrdU, nestin, and TLR2 in the DG in morphology. Proliferating cells in the DG were labelled by thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Three-labelled BrdU, nestin, and DAPI was used for the identification of newly generated NSCs. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to observe the expression of TLR2 from the level of protein and mRNA. We observed that BrdU(+)/nestin(+)/DAPI(+)cells accounted for84.30%+/- 6.54%among BrdU(+)cells; BrdU(+)and nestin(+)cells in the DG were also TLR2(+)cells. BrdU(+)cells and the expression of TLR2 (both protein and mRNA levelssults indicated that TLR2 was expressed on proliferating cells in the DG (NSCs possibly) and there was a potential correlation between increased TLR2 and proliferated NSCs after TBI. Taken together, these findings suggested that TLR2 was involved in endogenous neurogenesis in the DG after TBI.

Case Description The patient was a 31-year-old male, household ambulator (aid walker) and community wheelchair user who was 8.5 year post traumatic iSCI (T8 vertebra injury, AIS D). Intervention The patient participated in 12 sessions (three times/week for four weeks) of rTMS (1800 pulses, 10 Hz, intensity of 90% resting motor threshold) followed by BWSTT (15-20 min, moderate intensity). Outcomes After treatment, the patient's score increased 3 points on the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (walking independence) and he became a community ambulator with crutches. His American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) lower extremities motor score (motor function) increased from 33 to 45 points and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (functional independence) score increased from 23 to 29 for the mobility indoors/outdoors subscale. The patient's lower limb spasticity was reduced (Modified Ashworth Scale), and quality of life improved based on the Short-Form Health Survey - 36, and the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale showed considerable perception of improvement. Conclusion Ourreportsuggests that a short protocol of rTMS combined with BWSTT improved walking independence, motor function, spasticity, functional mobility and quality of life in this patient with iSCI.

Participation in the ABI TRS involved interdisciplinary rehabilitation, 2-4 times per week, for 3 months after hospital discharge.Results: There was evidence that at 3 months, participants with ABI TRS showed stabilized psychological wellbeing, and improvements in MPAI-4 ability and participation scores; in addition to improvements in SPRS occupational activity and living skills scores.Conclusion: A designated ABI TRS may improve the transition from hospital to home, and could form an important part of the brain injury rehabilitation continuum, between the inpatient and community setting.

Getting motivated: long-term perspectives on engaging in community-based programs after acquired brain injury	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; qualitative; interpretive description; community-dwelling	QUALITATIVE-ANALYSIS; PATIENT MOTIVATION; REHABILITATION; ENGAGEMENT; THERAPY; STROKE; INTERVENTIONS; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; DISORDERS	Background Low motivation is a common problem after acquired brain injury (ABI) and can persist for years after injury. Little is known, however, about perspectives of motivation with respect to engaging in the community, many years after ABI. Purpose To explore the client with ABI perspective of motivation and engagement in individuals based in community ABI programs. Method Interpretive description methods were utilized. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 individuals with an ABI. Findings Participants felt that both internal factors, such as feelings of hope, and external factors, such as social support, influence levels of motivation to engage. When positive internal and external motivators were enhanced, and negative internal and external motivators reduced, this gave rise to a sense of choice and control, which led to increased engagement. Implications Fostering positive aspects of rehabilitation and increasing choice and control may promote engagement. External motivators, such as reducing repetitiveness and promoting peer support, are motivators that community and clinical settings can implement relatively easily, whilst internal motivators such as attitudes toward therapy may need to be addressed continuously to enhance motivation and engagement.

Proposal of a Functional Impairment Symptom Scale for Concussion	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						brain; children; concussion; pediatric; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury	DURATION; RECOVERY; SPECIFICITY; RELIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; BURDEN; YOUTH	Clinicians currently administer patient-reported symptom scales to quantify and track concussion symptoms. These scales are based on subjective ratings without reference to the degree of functional impairment caused by the symptoms. Our objective was to develop a concussion symptom scale based on functional impairment and compare it to a widely used concussion symptom checklist. We conducted a retrospective chart review evaluating 133 patients age 9-22 with an acute concussion who completed 2 symptom checklists at their initial visit-the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) symptom evaluation (22 symptoms, 0-6 scale) and the proposed Functional Impairment Scale (22 symptoms, 0-3 scale related to degree of functional impairment). Mean total symptom score was 27.2 +/- 22.9 for Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3 and 14.7 +/- 11.9 for the Functional Impairment Scale. Pearson correlation between the scales was 0.98 (P< .001). Mean time from concussion to first visit was 6.9 +/- 6.2 days, and median clearance time after injury was 19 (95% CI 16-21) days. After adjusting for patient and injury characteristics, an increased score on each scale was associated with longer time to clearance (5-point increase in Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3 hazard ratio 0.885, 95% CI 0.835-0.938,P< .001; 2.5-point increase in Functional Impairment Scale hazard ratio 0.851, 95% CI 0.802-0.902,P< .001). We propose a concussion symptom scale based on functional impairment that correlates strongly with the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3 scale, demonstrates a similar association with time to clearance, and may provide a more intuitive approach to monitoring how symptoms are affecting patients recovering from concussion. Future research should aim to validate this scale through a prospective longitudinal study.

It has established construct validity and demonstrated sensitivity to emotion perception impairments in those with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite this, its lengthy administration has limited its use in clinical practice and rehabilitation. The current paper aimed to develop shortened versions of the CAVEAT and examine their psychometric properties. Methods The CAVEAT-S A and CAVEAT-S B (22 items each) and the CAVEAT-S AB (44 items) were developed using the original data. Comparability, reliability, construct and predictive validity were examined in the original sample (Study 1: 32 people with TBI and 32 demographically matched control participants) and a replication sample (Study 2: 18 adults with TBI and 21 demographically matched controls). Results All short forms produced comparable accuracy ratings to the full measure, as well as discriminating between people with or without a TBI. Shortened forms all correlated with other measures of emotion perception and social cognition and also predicted psychosocial outcomes in terms of self-reported interpersonal relationships. Internal reliability of the short forms was low relative to the longer forms, especially for the two very short measures. Conclusions The new shortened forms of the CAVEAT are promising tools that are sensitive and valid for assessing emotion perception in people with TBI for clinical purposes. Their application in other clinical disorders is yet to be examined.

J	LoGalbo, A; DaCosta, A; Webbe, F				LoGalbo, Anthony; DaCosta, Andrew; Webbe, Frank			Comparison of the PHQ9 and ImPACT symptom cluster scores in measuring depression among college athletes	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT			English	Article; Early Access						Athletes; concussion; depression	BASE-LINE; NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS; PREVALENCE; STATEMENT; GENDER	Accurate identification of athletes in need of mental health services is essential. The clinical utility of the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), a stand-alone measure of depression, was explored among Division II college athletes (n = 1,209) completing pre-participation concussion baseline assessments (mean age = 19.28), which also included Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). ImPACT's symptom inventory can be divided into four clusters: affective, cognitive, physical/somatic, and sleep. Most athletes (81.9%) did not endorse any items on the affective symptom cluster; however, 90 athletes (7.4%) fell above the cutoff of 5 for depression on the PHQ-9, and approximately half of all athletes endorsed one or more PHQ-9 items. Simple linear regressions revealed ImPACT's sleep symptom cluster as the best predictor of PHQ-9 total score; however, affective, cognitive, and physical symptom clusters significantly predicted PHQ-9 total score as well. Due to relative under-endorsement of items on ImPACT's affective symptom cluster compared to the PHQ-9, the clinical utility of incorporating a stand-alone measure of depression such as the PHQ-9 during baseline testing is supported.

Methods This was an observational study in an academic trauma centre including adult patients with a history of mTBI and no psychiatric history. Exclusion criteria were missing the follow-up phone calls, radiologic abnormalities, simultaneous injuries and refusal to participate. Outcomes were post-concussion syndrome according to the international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 (ICD-PCS) and persistence of more than one mTBI related symptoms at 1 and 3 months post-injury. Results From 364 enrolled patients, 16 (4.4%) developed ICD-PCS, whereas 28 (7.6%) and 8(2.1%) reported more than one symptom at one and three months, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed associations between ICD-PCS with more than one initial symptom in the emergency department (ED) and the non-motor vehicle collision (non-MVC) impact mechanism with area under curve of 0.77. The former variable was associated with the persistence of more than one post-concussion symptom at one and three months. Conclusion More than one symptom in the ED and the mechanism of injury not related to MVCs (sports, violence or fall injuries) may predict symptom persistence. Early treatment and follow-up strategies may be beneficial for vulnerable patients.

We evaluated the applicability and cost-effectiveness of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules after head trauma and rationalize the use of head computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods We retrospectively divided patients <18 years old who presented at a single institution in Brazil with minor head trauma into four groups: Group I (skull X-ray only), Group II (head CT only), Group III (X-ray and CT), and Group IV (observation only). Direct costs were calculated based on examination and length of hospitalization. The PECARN rules were applied retrospectively in each patient to determine who required a CT scan, and the costs were re-calculated. Results Of the 1328 patients, CT scans were performed in 36.4% and X-rays in 52.6%. The mean cost was USD 5.88, 34.58, 41.85, and 4.04 for Groups I-IV, respectively. After applying the PECARN rules, 77.6% of patients no longer required a CT scan, and overall costs were reduced from USD 16.71 to 7.88 (p< .001).Conclusion: The PECARN rules demonstrated a meaningful cost-effectiveness and should be applied to the Brazilian pediatric population.

Recently, controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and prognostic nutrition index (PNI) has been reported to predict prognosis following cancer and other diseases. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the CONUT score and PNI and 6-month outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 78 patients with STBI, including the CONUT score and PNI. Patients were divided into high CONUT group and low CONUT group. Patients were also divided into high PNI and low PNI group respectively. The 6-month outcome was evaluated by the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The unfavorable outcome was defined as mRS score >= 3. Results The unfavorable outcome group had lower Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores, serum albumin, total cholesterol, PNI, and higher CONUT scores (P < 0.05). Both CONUT scores and PNI were strongly correlated with mRS (r = 0.429,P < 0.05;r = -0.590,P < 0.05, respectively). After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios of CONUT scores and PNI for predicting unfavorable outcome were 10.478 (95% CI: 2.793-39.301) and -0.039 (95% CI: 0.008-0.204), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of CONUT scores for predicting unfavorable outcome was 0.777 (95% CI: 0.674-0.880,P < 0.01), which was similar to PNI (0.764, 95% CI: 0.657-0.87,P < 0.01).

Methods A total of 309 family members of individuals with severe TBI from Colombia, Denmark, Mexico, Norway and Spain participated. Rasch analysis of the FNQ-R and its 6 subscales was conducted. Results The Rasch analysis indicated a lack of fit of the 37-item FNQ-R to one single underlying construct of needs, and less than half of the items were invariant across the countries. Misfit of single items was revealed in the Need for Health Information, Need for Emotional Support, Need for Instrumental Support, Need for Professional Support and Need for Community Support Network subscales. Fit to the Rasch model was obtained after removal of misfitting items. The Involvement in Care subscale had too few items to be adequately assessed by the Rasch approach. Conclusion The FNQ-R is a well-targeted instrument for assessing the unmet needs of caregivers regarding the need for health information, emotional support, professional support and a community support network after some scoring adjustment and the removal of misfitting items. Caution should be taken when comparing responses across countries.

Patient concerns: A 62-year-old female patient suffered a head trauma after falling backward. While working at a height of 85cm above the floor, she fell backward and struck the occipital area of her head on the ground. The patient experienced cognitive dysfunction and depressive mood after the head trauma. Diagnoses: The patient was diagnosed as mild TBI due to falling backward. Interventions: Clinical evaluation of her brain was performed at 2 months after onset. Outcomes: DTT at 2 months after onset revealed narrowings in the right ventrolateral and both orbitofrontal PTTs, whereas both the dorsolateral and left ventrolateral PTTs were not reconstructed. Lessons: Injuries of the PTTs associated with a contrecoup brain injury were demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI.

In this study, a series of Rolipram-Tranilast hybrids were designed and synthesized. The neuroprotective activities of the Rolipram-Tranilast hybrids were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Compound 5 has been identified as the strongest neuroprotective molecule among the series with robust anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials. Compound 5 significantly increased the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels and the phosphorylated cAMP response elements binding protein (p-CREB) while it down-regulated phosphodiesterase-4 B (PDE4B) expression in vitro. Furthermore, compound 5 remarkably attenuated TBI and had a good safety profile in mice. Taken together, our findings suggested that compound 5 could serve as a novel promising lead compound in the treatment of TBI and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases associated with PDE4B and oxidative stress.

Exposure to paraquat associated with periodontal disease causes motor damage and neurochemical changes in rats	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Paraquat; Parkinson's disease; periodontal disease; neuroinflammation; agriculture chemicals	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS; TOXIC INFLUENCE; ORAL-HEALTH; CELL-DEATH; MITOCHONDRIAL; RISK	Exposure to paraquat is possibly involved with the development of several conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This condition is mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and the development of classical motor symptoms. Etiology includes exposure to environmental factors, such as the paraquat exposure, and inflammatory diseases may exacerbate paraquat neurotoxicity. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the exposure to paraquat associated with the presence of periodontal disease is able to induce motor and biochemical changes in rats similar to that observed in PD. Adult male Wistar rats were sent to ligature. After 48 h, they were sent to daily treatment paraquat (1 mg/kg/day; 2 mL/kg; intragastric) or vehicle for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, the open field test was performed. The rats were euthanized and the left hemimandibles and striatum were dissected for the analysis of dopaminergic and inflammatory markers. Only the combination of periodontal disease model plus paraquat exposure induced motor impairments. Remarkably, the paraquat exposure increased the ligature-induced alveolar bone loss in hemimandibles. Moreover, only the combination of periodontal disease and paraquat exposure induced the loss of dopaminergic neurons and astrocyte activation in the striatum.	[Fernandes, L. C.; Santos, A.

Pulsed Microwave Energy Transduction of Acoustic Phonon Related Brain Injury	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						microwave; phonon; U; S; embassy exposures; cognitive disorder; mTBI	US GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL; EXPOSURE; HEARING; HAVANA; SYSTEM	Pulsed microwaves above specific energy thresholds have been reported to cause brain injury in animal models. The actual physical mechanism causing brain damage is unexplained while the clinical reality of these injuries remains controversial. Here we propose mechanisms by which pulsed microwaves may injure brain tissue by transduction of microwave energy into damaging acoustic phonons in brain water. We have shown that low intensity explosive blast waves likely initiate phonon excitations in brain tissues. Brain injury in this instance occurs at nanoscale subcellular levels as predicted by physical consideration of phonon interactions in brain water content. The phonon mechanism may also explain similarities between primary non-impact blast-induced mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and recent clinical and imaging findings of unexplained brain injuries observed in US embassy personnel possibly due to directed radiofrequency radiation. We describe experiments to elucidate mechanisms, RF frequencies and power levels by which pulsed microwaves potentially injure brain tissue. Pathological documentation of nanoscale brain blast injury has been supported experimentally using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrating nanoscale cellular damage in the absence of gross or light microscopic findings. Similar studies are required to better define pulsed microwave brain injury. Based upon existing findings, clinical diagnosis of both low intensity blast and microwave-induced brain injury likely will require diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a specialized water based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique.

Although troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate (TCH) injections have been extensively used in clinics in China for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cerebral stroke, the potential efficacy of TCH injection in the treatment of SCI has never been revealed. In this study, the effects of administering TCH injections on neurological recovery in post-SCI rats were first tested with regard to the behavior and histology; subsequently, the specific expression profile of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) in their spinal cords were conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The LncRNA-mRNA networks were also elucidated. After SCI, we found that TCH injection with the right dose is effective for the recovery of locomotion function and repairing of the damaged tissue in the spinal cord; TCH injection is also discovered to have a role in the regulation of 443 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 27 differentially expressed LncRNAs (DELs) that are identified to have multiple functions, including locomotion, blood vessel morphogenesis, thiamine metabolism, Hippo signaling pathway, and axon guidance, by applying the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. In addition, it is revealed that, after SCI, the highly expressed LncRNA AABR07071383.1 in the post-SCI cis/trans-regulates the expression of mRNA Acpp mRNA that encodes a key enzyme involved in the metabolic process of thiamine in the abirritation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which implies that TCH injection may be more effective when administered with benfotiamine (a common treatment drug).

J	Andersen, MS; Pedersen, CB; Poulsen, FR				Andersen, Mikkel Schou; Pedersen, Christian Bonde; Poulsen, Frantz Rom			A new novel method for assessing intracranial pressure using non-invasive fundus images: a pilot study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; OPTIC-NERVE; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; HYPERTENSION; DIAMETER; SPACE	Arteriole and venule diameter ratio (A/V-ratio) can be measured using fundus photography. In this pilot study, we correlated changes in the intracranial pressure with the diameter of vessels of the retina. We investigated whether increased intracranial pressure (ICP) was reflected in a measurable and quantifiable distention of the venule diameter, leading to a decreased A/V-ratio. This was demonstrated by assessment of the A/V-ratio in patients already undergoing conventional ICP monitoring with a cerebral intraparenchymal pressure monitor. Our method shows a correlation between A/V ratio and ICP and suggests an easily obtainable and usable point-of-care (POC), non-invasive method to estimate the intracranial pressure without the necessity of mydriatic drugs. Furthermore, the sensitivity/specificity analysis with a cut-off of<0.8015 A/V-ratio, showed a sensitivity of 94% [85-98%] and a specificity of 50% [34-66%] with a positive likelihood ratio of 9.0. This means that in a clinical setting there is a 94% chance of correctly identifying individuals with ICP<greater than or equal to>20 mmHg.

I provide a conceptual model identifying mechanisms whereby the law could eitherincrease or decreaseorgan donation. Exploiting variation across states and time in the adoption of primary seat belt enforcement, I investigate these mechanisms and estimate the effect of the law on the supply of organs. The law increases seat belt usage and decreases motor vehicle accident fatalities, which translates to a sizeable reduction in the number of motor vehicle accident-based organ donors. In contrast, the law is not associated with changes in the number of organ donors from nonmotor vehicle accident-based sources and is robust to controlling for hospital-specific effects. The effects are concentrated within organs expected to be most negatively impacted by the seat belt. Although primary enforcement represents a net-gain to society in terms of lives saved, the negative impact on organ donation suggests further emphasis be placed on policies aimed at increasing the availability of organs.

Outcome measures from experimental traumatic brain injury in male rats vary with the complete temporal biomechanical profile of the injury event	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						fluid percussion; impulse; injury biomechanics; injury rate; injury severity; mild TBI; RRID; SCR_003137; RRID; SCR_002865; RRID; SCR_013726	LATERAL FLUID-PERCUSSION; ACUTE NEURONAL DEGENERATION; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; DENTATE GYRUS; ANIMAL-MODEL; FLUORO-JADE; HEAD-INJURY; IMPACT; DAMAGE	Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice-coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post-injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.

We examined the reliability of a commercially available assay for S100B used on the same samples by two different laboratories separated by 2 years in time. Methods and Procedures A cohort of 163 adult patients (head CT-scanned, n = 110) with mild head injury were enrolled from the emergency department (ED). All had Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 14 or 15 in the ED (94.4% = 15). The mean time between injury and venous blood sampling was 2.9 h (SD = 1.4; Range = 0.5-6.0 h). Serum S100B was measured at two independent centers using the same high throughput clinical assay (Elecsys S100B (R); Roche Diagnostics). Results The Spearman correlation between the two assays in the total sample (N = 163) was r = 0.93. A Wilcoxson Signed Ranks test indicated that the median scores for the values differed (Z = 2,082,p< .001, Cohen's d = 0.151, small effect size). The values obtained from the two laboratories were very similar for identifying traumatic intracranial abnormalities (sensitivity = 80.1% versus 85.7%). Conclusions The serum S100B results measured using the same assay in different laboratories yielded highly correlated and clinically similar, but clearly not identical, results.

Preinjury Antiplatelet Use Does Not Increase the Risk of Progression of Small Intracranial Hemorrhage	AMERICAN SURGEON			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Scientific Meeting of the Southeastern-Surgical-Congress (SESC)	FEB 08-11, 2020	New Orleans, LA	SE Surg Congr		traumatic brain injury; antiplatelets; aspirin		Background The modified brain injury guidelines (mBIG) provide an algorithm for surgeons to manage some mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) without neurosurgical consultation or repeat imaging. Currently, antiplatelet use among patients with any ICH classifies a patient at the highest level, mBIG 3. This study assesses the risk of clinical progression among patients taking antiplatelet medications with mild TBI with ICH. Methods A retrospective analysis of patients with traumatic ICH over a 5-year period was conducted. Demographics, injury severity, and outcome data were collected for each patient. Patients taking antiplatelet agents were reclassified as if they were not taking these medications. Patients who would have met criteria for a lower classification (mBIG 1 or 2) without antiplatelet agents were designated mBIG 3 Antiplatelet and compared with all other mBIG 1 and 2 patients. Results 736 patients met the inclusion criteria. 158 patients were taking antiplatelet medications and 53 were reclassified as mBIG 3 Antiplatelet. When comparing mBIG 3 Antiplatelet to the 226 patients originally classified as mBIG 1 and 2, mBIG 3 Antiplatelet patients were more likely to undergo repeat head computed tomography (98.1% vs 76.6%; P < .001) and neurosurgical consultation (94.2% vs 76.5%; P < .001) but had no significant differences in outcomes. No mBIG 3 Antiplatelet patients had a worsening examination or needed operative intervention. Discussion This data suggests that antiplatelet medication use should not automatically classify a patient as mBIG 3. Adoption of this strategy would better utilize resources and avoid unnecessary costs without sacrificing care.

A probe placed on the skin emits light that is absorbed, scattered, and reflected by the underlying tissue. Detectors in the probe sense the amount of reflected light: this reflects the organ-specific ratio of oxygen supply and consumption - independent of pulsatile flow. Modern devices enable the simultaneous monitoring at different body sites. A rise or dip in the rSO(2) curve visualizes changes in oxygen supply or demand before vital signs indicate them. The evolution of rSO(2) values in relation to the starting point is more important for interpretation than are absolute values. A routine clinical application of NIRS is the surveillance of somatic and cerebral oxygenation during and after cardiac surgery. It is also administered in preterm infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, newborns with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and a potential risk of impaired tissue oxygenation. In the future, NIRS could be increasingly used in multimodal neuromonitoring, or applied to monitor patients with other conditions (e.g., after resuscitation or traumatic brain injury).

Thirty eight patents diagnosed with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage were analysed in this study. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO(2)) was assessed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A CDE was defined as rSO(2) < 60% with a duration of at least 30 min. The severity of the aSAH was assessed using the Hunt and Hess scale and the short-term outcome was evaluated utilizing the Glasgow Outcome Scale. CDEs were found in 44% of the group. The total time of the CDEs and the time of the longest CDE on the contralateral side were longer in patients with severe versus moderate aSAH [h:min]: 8:15 (6:26-8:55) versus 1:24 (1:18-4:18), p = 0.038 and 2:05 (2:00-5:19) versus 0:48 (0:44-2:12), p = 0.038. The time of the longest CDE on the ipsilateral side was longer in patients with poor versus good short-term outcome [h:min]: 5:43 (3:05-9:36) versus 1:47 (0:42-2:10), p = 0.018. The logistic regression model for poor short-term outcome included median ABP, the extent of the haemorrhage in the Fisher scale and the time of the longest CDE. We have demonstrated that the time of a CDE is associated with the severity of haemorrhage and short-term outcome in aSAH patients. A NIRS measurement may provide valuable predictive information and could be considered as additional method of neuromonitoring of patients with aSAH.

Serum Concentrations of Neuron-Specific Enolase in Dogs Following Traumatic Brain Injury	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						dog; neuron-specific enolase; prognosis; traumatic brain injury	GLASGOW-COMA-SCALE; HEAD TRAUMA; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; BLOOD BIOMARKERS; PROTEINS; MARKER; S-100; PREDICTOR; S100B	The ability to make an accurate prognosis, which is a prerequisite for treatment decisions, is very limited in dogs with traumatic brain injury (TBI). To determine whether serum concentrations of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have prognostic value in dogs following TBI, we conducted a prospective, observational, controlled clinical study in an intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. The study population comprised 24 dogs admitted to the hospital within 72 h of a known event of TBI between January 2010 and January 2015, as well as 25 control healthy shelter dogs admitted for elective neutering. Seventeen injured dogs (70%) survived to discharge, four were euthanized and three died within 48 h. Serum samples were obtained from all dogs (in injured dogs, within 72 h of TBI) and NSE concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immonosorbent assay. Associations between NSE levels and outcome, Modified Glasgow Coma Scale, time to sampling, age or haemolysis scale were determined. Mean serum NSE concentrations were decreased in dogs with TBI compared with healthy controls (19.4 +/- 4.14 ng/ml vs. 24.9 +/- 4.6 ng/ml, P <0.001). No association was found between serum NSE concentrations and either survival or severity of neurological impairment. A negative correlation was found between serum NSE concentrations and time from trauma to blood collection (r = -0.50, P = 0.022). These results indicate that serum NSE concentration in dogs following TBI is not an effective marker for severity or outcome. Further studies are warranted to standardize serum NSE measurements in dogs and to determine the peak and half-life levels of this potential biomarker. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A safe return to driving is an objective significantly correlated with recovery of personal independence and social-occupational role. AIM: The study investigated elements predictive of the possibility of a safe return to driving after sABI, concentrating on motor disability and the need to prescribe vehicle assistive devices. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Out-patients of a rehabilitation center for sABI. POPULATION : A series of 217 patients with stable sABI, well reintegrated at family and social level, were enrolled between January 2006 and June 2019. METHODS: The subjects were assessed for residual competences. Those who passed assessment of cognitive-behavioral and visual impairment were assessed for motor disability and the need for vehicle assistive devices to enable a safe return to driving. RESULTS : About 79% of the population were judged suitable for a return to driving. More than 50% of the latter were only able to return to driving with the aid of vehicle assistive devices. Etiological and demographic variables were not predictive of assessment outcome, whereas the various Griffith motor disability categories were correlated with need for vehicle assistive devices, which are most needed in non-traumatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Although the literature on return to driving after brain injury focuses mainly on cognitive-behavioral impairment, in a significant percentage of cases it is also necessary to carefully analyse and manage motor disabilities that may result from sABI. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT : Evaluation of the competences necessary for a return to driving after sABI requires a multiprofessional team that must also assess motor disability and know the possible vehicle assistive devices that can enable most candidates to overcome the limits imposed by their disability.

J	Engell, M; Lauritsen, JM; Faergemann, C				Engell, Martine; Lauritsen, Jens Martin; Faergemann, Christian			Changes in the pattern of paediatric bicycle injuries in relation to helmet use 1980-2014	DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SAFETY HELMETS; LEGISLATION	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe long-term changes in injury pattern in bicycle accidents among children in relation to the increasing use of bicycle helmets. METHODS: This was a descriptive register study of all children aged 6-14 years with injuries from bicycle accidents who were treated at a Danish university hospital in the 1980-2014 period. Diagnoses and helmet use were analysed and stratified by gender and age group. Diagnoses were grouped into head injuries, severe head injuries, facial injuries, bone fractures, spinal injuries and internal injuries. We defined severe head injuries as skull fractures and intracranial injuries including concussions, haemorrhages and lacerations. RESULTS: We included 13,294 children, 58.7% were boys. From 1980-1984 to 2010-2014, the use of helmets increased from 0% to 49.9% in boys and from 0% to 57.1% in girls. The proportion of boys and girls with head injuries decreased from 31.3% to 17.4% and from 29.6% to 10.1%, respectively. A similar reduction was found in the proportion of children with severe head injuries. In the study period, the proportion of children with facial injuries, fractures, spinal injuries and internal injuries in trunk remained unchanged. Eighteen children died from their injuries, none of whom wore a helmet. CONCLUSIONS: In the study period, the proportion of head and severe head injuries decreased by 50% along with an increase from 0% to 50% in helmet use. The proportion of facial injuries, spinal injuries, bone fractures and injuries to the internal organs remained unchanged.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of NNOD and its association with out-comes in pediatric patients with TBI. We hypothesized that NNOD is associated with worse outcomes in pediatric patients with severe TBI. Methods: We performed a 4-year (2013-16) analysis of our prospectively maintained TBI database. All patients (age < 18) with an isolated-severe TBI (head-abbreviated injury scale: AIS >= 3 & extracranial-AIS < 3) were in-cluded. NNOD was measured using the pediatric multiple organ dysfunction (P-MOD) score. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), and adverse discharge disposition: rehabilita-tion or skilled nursing facility (SNF). Regression analysis was performed. Results: We analyzed 292 patients. Mean age was 11 +/- 6 years, 57% were male and the mortality rate was 18.1%. The incidence of NNOD was 35%. The most common dysfunctional organ system was the respiratory (25%) followed by the cardiovascular (12%). On regression analysis, the presence of at least one NNOD was indepen-dently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.1 [1.7-2.9]; p < 0.01), low GOS-E (OR 1.8 [1.5-2.3]; p < 0.01), and SNF disposition (OR 1.7 [1.2-2.1]; p < 0.01). Conclusion: NNOD develops in one of every three severe TBI pediatric patients and is independently associated with adverse outcomes. Identification of NNOD in pediatric TBI and focusing on management of NNOD could im-prove outcomes. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Harsh, V; Gond, PK; Kumar, A				Harsh, Viraat; Gond, Preeti K.; Kumar, Anil			Post-Traumatic Diploic Leptomeningeal Cyst with Bilateral Posterior Cranial Fossa Epidural Hygroma: A Management Dilemma?	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Epidural hygroma; Leptomeningeal cyst; Traumatic brain injury	SKULL	BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic diploic leptomeningeal cyst with bilateral posterior cranial fossa epidural hygroma is a rare complication after calvarial fracture. Very few cases have been reported to date; hence, there are no specific guidelines for the management of these cases. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department after suffering from head trauma caused by a fall from a rooftop where he was treated conservatively at a local hospital. Later, he developed swelling in the occipital region and was brought to the department of neurosurgery where he was operated on. After the first surgery, recurrence of swelling was seen after a postoperative period of 2 months, and computed tomography scan reported persistent epidural hygroma with extension into the subcutaneous space. The second surgery was performed, and 12-month follow-up did not show any recurrence of swelling in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Post-traumatic leptomeningeal cyst is commonly associated with occipital injury. The causes are as follows: the dura is very loosely attached to the intracranial lamina in young children, injury to the skull results in potential epidural space, and any tear or breach in the meninges leads to accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in these spaces giving rise to cystic swelling. Watertight duroplasty with trials of duro-periosteal hitching has been described in the management of these cases.

An Analysis of Youth Football Head Impact Data	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Concussion; CTE; Head injury; Youth football	CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; LIFE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL; 1ST EXPOSURE; CONCUSSION; PARTICIPATION; INJURY; AGE	BACKGROUND: The issue of whether sports-related head trauma at the youth level can result in long-term sequelae that may negatively impact the participant has been widely debated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate head impacts in the Summit Youth Football League equipped with helmets using the Riddell InSite impact monitoring system. The monitoring system allowed for analysis of the number of impacts and severity of impacts by player. METHODS: Data were obtained for all 20 members of the youth football team. Impacts were recorded as "low," "medium," and "high" intensity. RESULTS: All 20 players participated in all practices and games throughout the season. No player suffered a concussion throughout the entire season. There were 817 recorded impacts throughout the season. This was an average of 41 impacts per player over the course of the season and fewer than 4 impacts per player per week. Only one impact registered as "high". CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there are few head impacts over the course of an entire season at the middle school level. Guardian Caps, safe tackling techniques, and the age of participants may have contributed to the very low number of impacts recorded and the complete lack of injuries. This study only provides data demonstrating that youth football, when Guardian Caps and safe tackling techniques are enforced, does not appear to result in significant head impacts causing immediate head injuries. This study cannot comment on the safety of playing football at the collegiate or professional level.

Retrospective analyses were performed to identify such factors. The medical records of all patients who were admitted to Saiseikai Shiga Hospital with mild (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 14-15) or moderate (GCS score of 9-13) ASDH between April 2008 and March 2017 were reviewed. Comparisons between the patients who exhibited favorable and poor outcomes were performed. Then, independent factors that contributed to poor outcomes were identified via logistic regression analyses. A total of 266 patients with a mean age of 70.2 were included in this study. The most common concomitant injuries were subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAHs; 56.8%). The patients' Injury Severity Scores (ISS) ranged from 16 to 75 (median: 21). The 66 moderate ASDH patients exhibited significantly higher frequencies of surgery and mortality (24.2% and 13.6%, respectively) than the 200 mild ASDH patients (8.0% and 4.5%, respectively). The factors associated with poor outcomes were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06) and the ISS (OR: 1.24) in the mild ASDH patients, and older age (OR: 1.09) and the higher ISS (OR: 1.15) in the moderate group, too.

J	Jantz, PB				Jantz, Paul B.			Implementing environmental enrichment strategies to help children who have sustained a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury	SUPPORT FOR LEARNING			English	Article						TBI; enriched environment; neurorehabilitation; psychoeducational assessment; low incidence disabilities	REHABILITATION; AUTISM	Every year in the UK, a significant number of children sustain a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Children who sustain a moderate or severe TBI have been shown to experience continuing neurological decline in two or more domains up to five years post-injury. Environmental enrichment (EE)-which involves supplementing an environment with appropriately reinforced and rewarded, frequently changing, novel experiences-has been shown to effectively improve social and cognitive functioning in animals with experimental TBI. A growing body of evidence shows EE is also beneficial in the recovery of humans following a TBI. Children who have sustained a moderate or severe TBI often return to school and the educational setting is well-suited for the implementation of EE interventions during the later stages of TBI recovery. This paper reviews a variety of factors pertinent to moderate and severe TBI, neurorehabilitation and EE. It also offers EE considerations for educational professionals who are involved in the development and implementation of school-based interventions for children who have sustained a significant brain injury.

Methods A Finnish population-based cohort (n=328 903) of children born during 2001 to 2006 was followed up for hospital-treated injuries until the end of 2014 via linkage of nation-wide registers. The rate of first injury was compared in children with and without CP. The effect of CP type, gender, severe comorbidities (intellectual disability, epilepsy, hearing or visual impairment), and the type of injury was evaluated. Results Children with CP had an increased risk of injury compared with children without CP (unadjusted HR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 - 1.4, p=0.40). Girls with CP (n=191) had a higher risk of injury compared with girls without CP (29% vs 22%, HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.01). Any comorbidity increased the risk of injury (HR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.2, p = 0.015) among children with CP. Children with CP had a higher risk of traumatic brain injury (HR: 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4, p = 0.002) than children without CP. Conclusion Girls with CP had the highest risk of hospital-treated injury. Children with CP are particularly prone to traumatic brain injuries.

An Automated Kinematic Measurement System for Sagittal Plane Murine Head Impacts	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						head kinematics; traumatic brain injury (TBI); closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA); biomechanics	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AXONAL INJURY; ACCELERATION; BIOMECHANICS; CONCUSSION; THRESHOLD; MODELS	Mild traumatic brain injuries are typically caused by nonpenetrating head impacts that accelerate the skull and result in deformation of the brain within the skull. The shear and compressive strains caused by these deformations damage neural and vascular structures and impair their function. Accurate head acceleration measurements are necessary to define the nature of the insult to the brain. A novel murine head tracking system was developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of kinematic measurements obtained with high-speed videography. A three-dimensional (3D)-printed marker carrier was designed for rigid fixation to the upper jaw and incisors with an elastic strap around the snout. The system was evaluated by impacting cadaveric mice with the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) system using an energy of 0.7 J (5.29 m/s). We compared the performance of the head-marker system to the previously used skin-tracking method and documented significant improvements in measurement repeatability (aggregate coefficient of variation (CV) within raters from 15.8 to 1.5 and between raters from 15.5 to 1.5), agreement (aggregate percentage error from 24.9 to 8.7), and temporal response (aggregate temporal curve agreement from 0.668 to 0.941). Additionally, the new system allows for automated software tracking, which dramatically decreases the analysis time required (74% reduction). This novel head tracking system for mice offers an efficient, reliable, and real-time method to measure head kinematics during high-speed impacts using CHIMERA or other rodent or small mammal head impact models.

The Clinical Randomization of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Head injury (CRASH)-2 and CRASH-3 trials confirmed that tranexamic acid (TXA) was effective after trauma. Herein, we report a unique coagulation change in a patient with TBI given TXA after point-of-care assessment. Coagulation functions were impaired on admission. At 1 hour after TXA administration, clotting time was further prolonged in the extrinsic coagulation pathway but shortened in the intrinsic coagulation system. The results of a test of the total thrombus-formation analysis system showed improved blood clot formation ability. Intrinsic coagulation and clot formation improved after TXA administration in a TBI patient with coagulopathy.

Driving After Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury: Impact of Distraction and Executive Functioning	REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						adolescent driving; distracted driving; executive functioning; pediatric traumatic brain injury	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; TERM BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; DRIVER DISTRACTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; TASK DEMANDS; YOUNG-ADULTS; ROAD; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATOR	Objective: The objective of the current study was to examine the driving performance of young drivers with a history of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared with an uninjured control group. The impact of cell phone related distraction (conversation and texting) and executive functioning (EF) were also explored. Method: Individuals aged 16-25 years with (n = 19) and without (n = 19) a history of TBI engaged in a simulated drive under 3 distraction conditions (no distraction, cell phone conversation, and texting). Mean speed, maximum speed, standard deviation of speed, standard deviation of lane position, and crash rates were used as outcomes. The Global Executive Composite (GEC) from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) was used to measure EF. Results: Significant Injury x Distraction x GEC interaction effects were noted on max speed and speed variability, with a trending Distraction x GEC interaction noted for lane position variability. The effect of distraction was most notable among individuals with greater GEC scores, across both injury groups. Conclusions: A history of pediatric TBI did not specifically impact driving performance independent of EF, with EF playing a central role in functioning across domains of driving performance. Consistent effect of EF suggests that deficits in driving performance may he associated with EF specifically, with individuals with EF difficulties following TBI at greater risk for poor driving performance.

J	Neumann, M; Gild, A; Mauch, F				Neumann, Markus; Gild, Andreas; Mauch, Frieder			The complex course of a concussion and an exceptional diagnosis	SPORTVERLETZUNG-SPORTSCHADEN			German	Article						concussion; handball; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; traumatic brain injury; sports injury; Lyme disease; borreliosis	RECURRENT CONCUSSION; SPECTRUM; DISEASE; INJURY; SPORT; RISK	Concussion without loss of consciousness is common in every sport, but it occurs more often in high-impact sports such as handball or soccer. Concussion should be diagnosed early to protect the athlete. It is not easy to diagnose a concussion, but tests like the SCAT-5 can help. After the diagnosis, the athlete should undergo a return-to-sports procedure. Multiple concussions can cause long-term neurological deficits known as chronic traumatic encephalitis. If symptoms persist or clinical deterioration occurs, various differential diagnoses, some of them life threatening, have to be ruled out. In our case, a 29-year-old professional handball player was diagnosed with concussion and distortion of the cervical spine. Due to increasing symptoms and partly severe deterioration, the patient saw several doctors and underwent several diagnostic procedures. The correct diagnosis was made four weeks after the trauma. Today the player is playing handball on a professional basis again without any restriction.

The ICP-related parameters included ICP, ICP dose (DICP), regression of the correlation coefficient between amplitude and pressure (RAP), pressure reactivity index (PRx), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Methods A retrospective analysis was performed using clinical information from 29 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery from January 2018 to January 2019. All patients underwent ICP probe implantation after admission. Patients were followed up for 6 months after discharge, and were categorized into either the favorable or unfavorable outcome group based on their Glasgow Outcome Scale score. The differences in ICP, DICP, RAP, PRx, and CPP between the two groups were analyzed for their effects on outcome. Results The average ICP, DICP, PRx, and RAP values in patients with favorable outcomes were significantly lower than in patients with unfavorable outcomes, while CPP values were significantly higher in the favorable outcome group. Conclusion Average ICP, DICP, PRx, RAP, and CPP values may indicate disease status and relate to patient outcomes. It is important to use multiple parameters to predict patients' disease severity and prognosis.

However, the best method to enhance the transfer of learning for teachers remains to be elucidated. Application of Adult Learning Theory (ALT) is a plausible solution to this problem. Purpose: The purpose of this randomized post-test study was to examine the effects of ALT on the transfer of learning in teachers who work with individuals with concussion. Methods: A convenience sample of 169 teachers at four middle schools were randomized to receive an in-service regarding concussion management either in ALT or traditional lecture format. Vignettes approximating classroom practice evaluated learning transfer. Results: one-way between subjects ANOVA revealed no significant difference between the methods of educational delivery on group assessment scores (p = .22). Additionally, a regression analysis did not identify any demographic variables that predicted learning transfer (p = .65). A statistically significant difference existed for four questions (1, 4, 7, 25) between the groups (p = .03, .02, .01, .00, respectively). These vignettes were those that assessed information that was likely novel to the learner. Discussion: The current study demonstrated that ALT applied to teacher in-service did not impact transfer of learning immediately post training compared to a traditional lecture format. Future research should continue to examine the effects of various educational strategies to enhance learning transfer for teachers managing students in the classroom after concussion.

Some deserve wider recognition; this is especially true for the field of neurosurgery. There are a limited number of historical records currently available, fewer still in English, and most of the systematic investigations on field surgery have been in the form of monographs within science history reviews, which obviously lack a strictly clinical perspective. Together with shell shock, the gunshot-related traumatic brain injury (GrTBI) is considered one of the typical, or signature, lesions of the Great War. It was intrinsically linked to trench and mountain warfare: to view the battlefield from a trench/hiding area, soldiers' heads and necks were repeatedly exposed, therefore making them the most likely target for snipers. Military physicians therefore focused their efforts in the clinical and experimental treatment of GrTBI. Among notable contributions of the military surgeons of the time, there is a volume of selected war-surgery lectures conserved in the archives of the Library of the Italian National Academy of Military Medicine. These lectures shed light over the work of General Dr. Lorenzo Bonomo. His incredibly advanced and modern ideas had unfortunately been forgotten. He pioneered research in the ballistic and forensic medical fields, building on first-hand experience, as he performed surgeries himself before the conflict and even while on the frontline, actively working to improve the chances of survival for the Italian troops fighting in the Great War.

Palliative Care Consultation and Effect on Length of Stay in a Tertiary-Level Neurological Intensive Care Unit	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						brain injury; cerebrovascular accident; neurocritical care; neurosurgery; palliative care; palliative medicine	ICU; SURGEONS; LIFE	Background: Patients admitted to an acute care setting with a devastating brain injury are at high risk for morbidity and mortality. These patients and their families can benefit from the psychosocial and decision-making support of a palliative care consultation.Objective: We aim to investigate the characteristics and impact of palliative care consultation for patients under the management of neurosurgical and critical care services with a devastating brain injury in a neurological intensive care unit (ICU) at a large tertiary-care hospital.Design: Data were collected by retrospective review of the electronic medical record and metrics collected by the palliative care service. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess effect of timing of palliative care consultation.Results: Fifty-five patients admitted to the neurological ICU under the management of the neurosurgical service received a palliative care consultation for the following: hemorrhagic stroke (49%), metastatic cancer (22%), and traumatic brain injury (18%). Of these, 73% had at least one neurosurgical intervention. Palliative care was most frequently consulted for assistance in defining a patient's goals of care (88%). When compared with late consultation, early palliative care consultation was significantly associated with shorter mean length of stay (LOS) and positively correlated in linear regression analysis without an effect on mortality.Conclusions: When compared with a late consultation, early palliative care consultation corresponded to shorter LOS without increasing mortality. One reason for this effect may be that palliative care can help to clarify and document goals of care earlier and more concretely.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cognitive ageing is exacerbated in elite soccer players compared to the general population. Method: Neurocognitive performance in 6 domains was compared between 240 elite soccer players and a normative sample from the general population (n = 585) using the computerised test battery CNS Vital Signs. We used two-way factorial ANOVA to analyse the interaction between age groups (15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49 years) and study population (female soccer players vs. norm sample) in their effects on neurocognitive performance. Results: We found no significant interaction effect of age group and study population in five of six test domains. For processing speed, the effect of age was more pronounced in female soccer players (F= 16.89,p= .002). Further, there was a clear main effect of study population on neurocognitive performance with generally better scores in soccer players. Conclusions: Elite female soccer players generally performed better than the norm sample on tests of cognitive function, and further, cognitive ageing effects were similar in elite soccer players and controls in all but one domain. A lifespan approach may facilitate insightful future research regarding questions related to long-term neurocognitive health in contact sport athletes.

Comprehensive appreciation of the pathology is limited given the lack of granular metadata available. In this proof-of-concept study, we analyzed demographic data on TBI generated from a novel, prospective, online database in a lower-middle income country. METHODS: Neurosurgery residents were given an electronic tablet for data entry into an online database. Metadata-driven data capture was carried out prospectively by trained residents, and the information was reviewed weekly by the supervising team in the United States. RESULTS: Complete data were available on 242/253 (96%) patients. Age at admission was 37 years (range 16-85), and length of stay was 3.53 days (1-21). Etiologies included motorcycle accidents, falls, assaults, pedestrian vehicular injuries, and industrial accidents. Dispositions were primarily to home (211). Average Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission was 12.97. There was a 68% mortality rate of patients directly admitted to the North Okkalappa General and Teaching Hospital with a Glasgow Coma Scale score <8 versus 75% for patients transferred in from other facilities. Surgery was performed on 30 patients (12.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of formal training in electronic medical records or research, the resident team was able to capture the majority of admissions with granular-level data. This helped shed light on the etiology and severity of TBI in Myanmar. As a result, more effective transport systems and access to trauma care must be achieved. Accessible regional trauma centers with investment in intensive care units, operative care, anesthesia, and imaging resources are necessary.

A 3D Tissue Model of Traumatic Brain Injury with Excitotoxicity That Is Inhibited by Chronic Exposure to Gabapentinoids	BIOMOLECULES			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; tissue engineering; excitotoxicity; 3D neural tissues; voltage-gated calcium channels	CALCIUM-CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS; SPREADING DEPOLARIZATIONS; RAT MODEL; MECHANISMS; KETAMINE; SILK; NMDA; EPILEPSY; ATROPHY; NEURONS	Injury progression associated with cerebral laceration is insidious. Following the initial trauma, brain tissues become hyperexcitable, begetting further damage that compounds the initial impact over time. Clinicians have adopted several strategies to mitigate the effects of secondary brain injury; however, higher throughput screening tools with modular flexibility are needed to expedite mechanistic studies and drug discovery that will contribute to the enhanced protection, repair, and even the regeneration of neural tissues. Here we present a novel bioengineered cortical brain model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that displays characteristics of primary and secondary injury, including an outwardly radiating cell death phenotype and increased glutamate release with excitotoxic features. DNA content and tissue function were normalized by high-concentration, chronic administrations of gabapentinoids. Additional experiments suggested that the treatment effects were likely neuroprotective rather than regenerative, as evidenced by the drug-mediated decreases in cell excitability and an absence of drug-induced proliferation. We conclude that the present model of traumatic brain injury demonstrates validity and can serve as a customizable experimental platform to assess the individual contribution of cell types on TBI progression, as well as to screen anti-excitotoxic and pro-regenerative compounds.

However, those effects are incompletely described. It was our aim to evaluate in vitro effects of FFP on endothelial key functions and to identify underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were prestimulated with LPS, followed by incubation with FFP. Permeability for FITC-dextran was assessed, and intercellular gap formation was visualized. NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-adhesion, and leakage-related genes were evaluated, and monocyte adhesion to ECs was assessed. Intracellular cAMP levels as well as phosphorylation of functional proteins were analyzed. In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, Syndecan-1 serum levels were assessed prior to and following FFP transfusion. Key findings: Post-incubation of HPMVECs with FFP increased intracellular cAMP levels that had been decreased by preceding LPS stimulation. On one hand, this reduced endotoxin-mediated upregulation of IL-8, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, VEGF, and ANG-2. Impaired phosphorylation of functional proteins was restored, and intercellular cohesion and barrier function were rescued. On the other hand, NF-kappa B nuclear translocation as well as monocyte adhesion was markedly increased by the combination of LPS and FFP. Syndecan-1 serum levels were lower in surgery patients that were transfused with FFP compared to those that were not.

John			Developing common demographic data elements to include in future editions of the SCAT and Child SCAT: a modified international Delphi study	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article							CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; CONCUSSION; FOOTBALL; CRITERIA; ZURICH; RETURN; PLAY	Background The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) and Child SCAT are the 'gold standard' assessment tools for a suspected sport-related concussion (SRC). A number of 'modifiers' (eg, previous history of concussion) of a SRC have been identified. These may influence how the SCAT/Child SCAT results should be interpreted. Objectives To achieve consensus, via an international panel of SRC experts, on which athlete/player and parent/caregiver demographic variables should be considered for inclusion in future editions of the SCAT/ Child SCAT respectively. Methods A two-round modified Delphi technique, overseen by a steering committee, invited 41 panellists to achieve expert consensus (>= 80% agreement). The first round utilised open questions to generate demographic variables; the second round used a five-point ordinal item to rank the importance of including each variable in future editions of the SCAT/Child SCAT. Results 15 experts participated in at least one Delphi round. 29 athlete/player and eight parent/caregiver variables reached consensus for inclusion in the SCAT, whereas two parent/caregiver variables reached consensus for exclusion. 28 athlete/player and four parent/caregiver variables reached consensus for the Child SCAT, whereas two parent/caregiver variables reached consensus for exclusion. Key categories of variables included the following: concussion/sport details, personal medical conditions and family medical history. Conclusion This study provides a list of athlete/player and parent/caregiver demographic variables that should be considered in future revisions of the SCAT/Child SCAT. By considering (and ultimately likely including) a wider and standard set of additional demographic variables, the Concussion in Sport experts will be able to provide clinicians and researchers with data that may enhance interpretation of the individual's data and the building of larger datasets.

Pharmacology and clinical use of plasma expanders	ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						Albumin; colloids; critical care; dextrans; fluid therapy; gelatin; hydroxyethyl starch; plasma substitutes; surgical procedures	FLUID RESUSCITATION; HYDROXYETHYL STARCH; ALBUMIN REPLACEMENT; SEVERE SEPSIS; SALINE	Plasma expanders are colloidal solutions that expand the circulating blood volume more than isotonic crystalloids and are among the most commonly used fluids in critical care and perioperative medicine worldwide. We begin our review of these agents by introducing the modified Starling model, which incorporates the fundamental physiologic role of the endothelial glycocalyx in transcapillary fluid movement. Next, we individually discuss each fluid, starting with their relevant pharmacological properties before delving into the trials on their clinical use. Human trial data on gelatins and dextrans are scarce, making their routine use difficult to justify outside resource-poor settings. Trials on the use of hydroxyethyl starch in critical care imply increased risk of kidney injury, coagulopathy and, possibly, mortality; whether these harms apply to the surgical setting remains an area of debate and ongoing study, but there is no compelling evidence to support the routine use of hydroxyethyl starch in the operating room. Multiple trials suggest that albumin is a safe, albeit more expensive, alternative to crystalloid use in the intensive care unit, with secondary analyses suggesting harm in traumatic brain injury and benefit in septic shock. Finally, more data are required to better define the role of albumin in perioperative medicine.	[Teixeira, J.

In this ethnography of one such clinic, I explore the problem of veterans' forgetting. I focus on doctors' strategy of actively drawing attention to the ambiguous causes of forgetting to reposition past head injuries as among many possible explanations, including posttraumatic stress, pain, and everyday distractions. This leveraging of ambiguity as therapy highlights both the utility of and tensions inherent in the expansive clinical gaze of therapeutic medicine.

Delayed short-term tamoxifen treatment does not promote remyelination or neuron sparing after spinal cord injury	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMBINATION; CELLULAR INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; IMPROVES LOCOMOTOR RECOVERY; AXONAL PHYSIOLOGY; PROGENITOR CELLS; BREAST-CANCER; OLIGODENDROCYTE; ESTROGEN; EXPRESSION; CONTUSION	The tamoxifen-dependent Cre/lox system in transgenic mice has become an important research tool across all scientific disciplines for manipulating gene expression in specific cell types. In these mouse models, Cre-recombination is not induced until tamoxifen is administered, which allows researchers to have temporal control of genetic modifications. Interestingly, tamoxifen has been identified as a potential therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury patients due to its neuroprotective properties. It is also reparative in that it stimulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, it is unknown whether tamoxifen is neuroprotective and neuroreparative when administration is delayed after SCI. To properly interpret data from transgenic mice in which tamoxifen treatment is delayed after SCI, it is necessary to identify the effects of tamoxifen alone on anatomical and functional recovery. In this study, female and male mice received a moderate mid-thoracic spinal cord contusion. Mice were then gavaged with corn oil or a high dose of tamoxifen from 19-22 days post-injury, and sacrificed 42 days post-injury. All mice underwent behavioral testing for the duration of the study, which revealed that tamoxifen treatment did not impact hindlimb motor recovery. Similarly, histological analyses revealed that tamoxifen had no effect on white matter sparing, total axon number, axon sprouting, glial reactivity, cell proliferation, oligodendrocyte number, or myelination, but tamoxifen did decrease the number of neurons in the dorsal and ventral horn. Semi-thin sections confirmed that axon demyelination and remyelination were unaffected by tamoxifen. Sex-specific responses to tamoxifen were also assessed, and there were no significant differences between female and male mice. These data suggest that delayed tamoxifen administration after SCI does not change functional recovery or improve tissue sparing in female or male mice.

This literature is extended to include the foregone playing time of players as an additional injury cost. Design/methodology/approach The authors have reviewed the literature on the cost of players' injuries to professional sports leagues and other organizations. Findings The authors concluded that players' injury costs are substantial and sufficiently variable to be a primary source of financial uncertainty for a team.

Our objective is to compare the correlations among the default mode, salience, and central executive networks in patients with mTBI and healthy controls. Methods:This 2-year prospective study included 32 acute mTBI patients and 37 healthy comparisons. We calculated the functional connectivity scores among the default mode, salience, and central executive networks. Then we conducted multilevel correlation analysis to investigate component correlations, global graph, and local functional connectivity changes. Results:Patients with mTBI showed significant increased functional connectivity between the anterior part of the default mode network and the salience network compared with controls (p= 0.013, false discovery rate correction). Hyper-connectivity between the default mode and salience network was significantly positively correlated with the dimensional change card sort score in patients with mTBI (r= 0.40,p= 0.037). The average path length of mTBI patients was significantly higher than that of controls (p= 0.028). Conclusions:Aberrant functional coupling between the default mode and salience networks were identified in acute mTBI patients. Our finding has great potential to improve our understanding of the network architecture of mTBI.

Centre of pressure velocity shows impairments in NCAA Division I athletes six months post-concussion during standing balance	JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						Sport-related concussion; biomechanical balance; return to play	HIGH-SCHOOL; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; RECOVERY; VALIDITY; SINGLE; INJURY; TASK	Sport-related concussion return to play (RTP) decisions are largely based on the resolution of self-reported symptoms and neurocognitive function. Some evaluators also incorporate balance; however, an objective approach to balance that can detect effects beyond the acute condition is warranted. The purpose of this study is to examine linear measures of biomechanical balance up to 6 months post-concussion, and to present preliminary diagnostic thresholds useful for RTP. Each concussed athlete participated in instrumented standing balance tasks at 4 timepoints post-concussion. The measures from concussed athletes were compared to the sport-matched non-concussed athlete group at each timepoint. Centre of pressure (COP) mediolateral (ML) velocity in double-leg stance on a hard surface discriminated well between non-concussed and concussed athletes. COP anterior-posterior (AP) velocity in tandem stance on foam showed sensitivity to concussion. Sixty per cent of athletes at 6 months post-concussion did not recover to within the proposed COP ML velocity threshold in double-leg stance on a hard surface. Seventy-one per cent of athletes at 6 months post-concussion did not recover to within the COP AP velocity threshold in tandem stance on foam. This lack of recovery potentially indicates vestibular and motor control impairments long past the typical period of RTP.

Cerebral blood flow changes during palpation of external airway structures in healthy volunteers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; TRACHEAL INTUBATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; DIRECT LARYNGOSCOPY; HYPERTENSION; INDUCTION	Introduction Previous studies demonstrate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during direct laryngoscopy in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Worse outcomes in TBI have been associated with increased ICP. It remains unclear if the same effect occurs during cricothyrotomy. We evaluated changes in cerebral blood flow and hemodynamic changes that occurred during preparation for cricothyrotomy in healthy volunteers. Methods An emergency medicine trainee performed routine anatomical procedural palpation with simultaneous transcranial doppler (TCD) measurements of cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) from bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded throughout event. Our primary outcome was changes in pulsatility index (PI) and CBFV by TCD during palpation. TCD measurements were used as a surrogate for ICP. Results We enrolled 20 healthy volunteers for this study. No significant differences were found in pulsatility index [Right MCA -0.02 (95% confidence interval, -0.09 to 0.06), left MCA -0.02 (95% confidence interval, -0.011 to 0.07)] or mean CBFV [right MCA -0.70 mm/s (95% confidence interval, -10.15 to 8.75) left MCA -1.20 mm/s (95% confidence interval, -10.68 to 8.28)] during palpation. No significant change in HR was found [-1.1 bpm ((95% confidence interval, -2.4 to 0.1)]. A change in MAP was observed [1.3 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 2.4)].

Hypothesis: Concussion injuries commonly occur in high school sports programs. The likelihood of concussion among student-athletes (aged 13-18 years) depends on the sport they are participating in as well as the sex of the athlete. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all Hawaii high school athletes aged 13 to 18 years participating in 14 sports from 2011 through 2017 was performed as part of a statewide standardized concussion assessment and management program. Results: A total of 5993 concussions were identified among 92,966 athletes. The overall concussion rate was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99). Girls' judo had the highest concussion rate (1.92; 95% CI, 1.68-2.17) followed by football (1.60; 95% CI, 1.53-1.66). The concussion rate for boys (1.0; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03) was higher than that for girls (0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.95); however, in 4 of the 5 sports in which both girls and boys participated, girls had a higher rate of concussion injury. Conclusion: The likelihood of concussion among student-athletes aged 13 to 18 years may be higher than previously thought and varies depending on sport and sex.

In mild and moderate TBI, there is a time to treatment interaction, with early treatment being most beneficial. Time to treatment was recorded by clinicians and is subject to error. Using monitoring data from the CRASH-3 trial, we examine the impact of errors in time to treatment on estimated treatment effects. Methods The CRASH-3 trial was a randomised trial of the effect of tranexamic acid on death and vascular occlusive events in 12,737 TBI patients. This analysis includes the 8107 patients with a Glasgow coma scale score of 9 to 15 since previous analyses showed that these patients benefit most from early treatment. Clinician-recorded time to treatment was checked against ambulance and hospital records for 1368/12,737 (11%) patients. Patients who died were preferentially selected for monitoring and we monitored 36% of head injury deaths. We describe measurement errors using Bland-Altman graphs. We model the effect of tranexamic acid on head injury death using logistic regression with a time-treatment interaction term. We use regression calibration, multiple imputation and Bayesian analysis to estimate the impact of time to treatment errors. Results Clinicians rounded times to the nearest half or full hour in 66% of cases. Monitored times were also rounded and were identical to clinician times in 63% of patients. Times were underestimated by an average of 9 min (95% CI - 85, 66). There was more variability between clinician-recorded and monitored times in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. The treatment effect estimate at 1 h was greater for monitored times OR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.47, 0.81) than for clinician-recorded times OR = 0.63 (95% CI 0.48, 0.83). All three adjustment methods gave similar time to treatment interactions. For Bayesian methods, the treatment effect at 1 h was OR = 0.58 (95% CI 0.43, 0.78). Using monitored times increased the time-treatment interaction term from 1.15 (95% CI 1.03, 1.27) to 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.28). Conclusions Accurate estimation of time from injury to treatment is challenging, particularly in low resource settings. Adjustment for known errors in time to treatment had minimal impact on the trial results.

J	Lin, HL; Yen, JC				Lin, Hsin-Le; Yen, Ju-Chuan			Acute monocular nasal hemianopia following a mild traumatic brain injury A case report	MEDICINE			English	Article						hemianopia; indirect traumatic optic neuropathy; optic nerve; traumatic brain injury	SECONDARY	Introduction: Monocular hemianopia is a visual field defect with an uncommon pattern. The etiology of monocular temporal hemianopia has been well-evaluated and has been suggested to result from an optic nerve or chiasmal lesion. However, the etiology of monocular nasal hemianopia remains unclear. Patient concerns: Here, we present the case of a 41-year-old male who was punched on the head with fists during a fight and then suffered from painless blurred vision in the left eye after mild traumatic brain injury. An ophthalmic examination revealed a conjunctival chemosis, periorbital hematoma, and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Automated perimetry indicated there was a left side nasal hemianopia along the vertical meridian. Diagnosis: Examination of the fundus showed there was a normal appearing retina and disc bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography revealed no delayed filling of the vessels. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings of the visual pathways, orbit, and brain. A diagnosis of left traumatic optic neuropathy was made. Interventions: Systemic steroid pulse therapy (1 gram of intravenous methylprednisolone per day) was given to the patient for 3 days. Outcomes: An ophthalmologic examination after treatment indicated there was no obvious improvement in the relative afferent pupillary defect, best corrected visual acuity, and color sense. A second set of automated perimetry results showedno changes after 3 months. Conclusion: Monocular nasal hemianopia caused by traumatic optic neuropathy is uncommon. In this case, monocular nasal hemianopia was likely due to ischemic changes from impairment of the prechiasmal arterial anastomotic network or indirect injury to the lateral prechiasmal nerve fiber.

However, reconstructing the cranial defect brings many challenges to neurosurgeons and search for ideal implant materials is one of the most controversial issues. Although many studies have compared the outcomes of titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cranioplasty, yet no prospective study exists to guide the choice of titanium and PEEK materials. Methods/design: A non-randomized, partially blinded, prospective cohort study is described that comprehensively compares the long-term outcomes of titanium cranioplasty versus PEEK cranioplasty. One hundred forty-five patients for each group will be recruited. Eligible patients are those with cranial defect due to traumatic brain injury (>= 16 years), defect size is over 25 cm(2)and they must agree to participate in the trial. Each participant is evaluated before surgery, on discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months after cranioplasty. The primary outcome is the infection, implant failure and implant deformation requiring revision surgery within 12 months. Secondary outcomes include postoperative complication rate, neurological outcomes, motor function, and cosmetic outcome over a 6-month period. Discussion: Search for ideal implant materials is throughout the history of cranioplasty. This study will provide robust evidence for the choice of cranioplasty materials.

Low complication tolerance in developed countries and risk uncertainty, often cause excessive observation, diagnostics and hospitalization, considered unnecessary and expensive. Risk factors predicting ICH, progression and death in patients hospitalized with mild TBI have not been identified yet. Methods Mild TBI cases indicated for cranial computer tomography (CT) and hospitalization, according to international guidelines, at our Level I Trauma Center between 2008 and 2018 were retrospectively included. Multivariate logistic regression was performed for ICH, progression and mortality predictors. Results 1788 mild TBI adults (female: 44.3%; age at trauma: 58.0 +/- 22.7), were included. Skull fracture was diagnosed in 13.8%, ICH in 46.9%, ICH progression in 10.6%. In patients < 35 years with mild TBI, chronic alcohol consumption (p = 0.004) and skull fracture (p < 0.001) were significant ICH risk factors, whilst in patients between 35 and 65 years, chronic alcohol consumption (p < 0.001) and skull fracture (p < 0.001) revealed as significant ICH predictors. In patients with mild TBI > 65 years, age (p = 0.009), anticoagulation (p = 0.007) and neurocranial fracture (p < 0.001) were significant, independent risk factors for ICH, whilst increased age (p = 0.01) was a risk factor for mortality following ICH in mild TBI. Late-onset ICH only occurred in mild TBI cases with at least two of these risk factors: age > 65, anticoagulation, neurocranial fracture. Overall hospitalization could have been reduced by 15.8% via newly identified low-risk cases. Conclusions Age, skull fracture and chronic alcohol abuse require vigilant observation. Repeated CT in initially ICH negative cases should only be considered in newly identified high-risk patients. Non-ICH cases aged < 65 years do not gain safety from observation or hospitalization. Recommendations from our data might, without impact on patient safety, reduce costs by unnecessary hospitalization and diagnostics.

A cluster randomized controlled trial, stratified by area and hospital function, was employed in 45 obstetrics hospitals/clinics in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. In the intervention group, mothers watched an educational video on infant crying and the dangers of shaking and smothering an infant, within 1 week of age, during hospitalization at maternity wards, without blinding on group allocation. Control group received usual care. A total of 4722 (N = 2350 and 2372 for intervention and control group, respectively) mothers who delivered their babies (still birth and gestational age < 22 weeks were excluded) between October 1, 2014, and January 31 were recruited. Outcomes were self-reported shaking and smothering behaviors, knowledge on infant crying and shaking, and behaviors to cope with infant crying, assessed via a questionnaire at a 1-month health checkup. In all, 2718 (N = 1078 and 1640) responded to the questionnaire (response rate: 58.3%), and analytic sample size was 2655 (N = 1058 and 1597 for intervention and control group, respectively). Multilevel analysis was used to adjust for correlation within the cluster. Prevalence of shaking was significantly lower in the intervention group (0.19%) than in the control group (1.69%). Intention-to-treat analysis showed an 89% reduction in the reported prevalence of self-reported shaking (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.53) due to watching the educational video. However, self-reported smothering behavior showed no significant reduction (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.27-1.60). No side effects were reported. Watching an educational video on infant crying and the dangers of shaking and smothering within 1 week after delivery at maternity wards reduced self-reported shaking at 1 month of age.

Plasma Phospholipid Metabolites Associate With Functional Outcomes Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Older Adults	BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NURSING			English	Article						metabolomics; phospholipids; head injury; aged	LIPIDS	Objective: To compare differences using a metabolomics approach in older adults (>= 55) with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) to control adults and to identify a signature profile related to functional outcome 3-6 months post-injury. Methods: We performed metabolomics analysis using LC-MS of untargeted aqueous metabolites on plasma samples taken from a parent prospective cohort study. Older adults with mTBI (n = 14) were purposively sampled to include participants with worsening (decrease in GOS-E of at least 1 level) and improved (increase in GOS-E of at least 1 level) outcomes from 3 to 6 months. The data were analyzed using PLS-DA with VIP scores, Random Forest, and spline fit between the different groups as a function of time for exposure on outcome. Results: Separation of comparisons were seen at 24 hours (negative ionization) and 6 months (positive ionization), revealing two metabolites of interest, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylcholine levels were higher in those with mTBI compared to controls (p< 0.05), while lower concentration of phosphatidylethanolamine was seen in those with mTBI compared to controls (p< 0.05). Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate was significant in those with mTBI compared to controls (n = 10) based on improved (n = 6) versus worsened (n = 8) outcomes from 3 to 6 months. Conclusion: We identified plasma metabolites related to phospholipid metabolism in older adults following mTBI and associated with long-term functional outcome.

This study reports the visual profile of patients with ABI seen in Neuro-Optometry Clinic (NOC) at a tertiary eye-care center in Southern India. Methods A retrospective study was carried out between January 2014 and December 2015. Medical records of patients diagnosed with ABI referred by Neuro-Ophthalmologists to the NOC were reviewed. The detailed history, clinical findings of neuro assessment and management details were recorded. Results Of the 241 patients with ABI, 208 had Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and 33 had Cerebro-Vascular Accident (CVA). The mean (SD) age of patients with TBI was 35 +/- 14 years and CVA was 52 +/- 16 years. Binocular diplopia (61%) was seen predominantly in TBI due to vertical deviation (31%). Cranial nerve palsy was most common in TBI (55%) than CVA (36%) and visual field defects were most frequently seen in CVA (27%). Conclusion Cranial nerve paresis and restrictive strabismus with diplopia were the most common presentations in TBI and visual field defects in CVA. A neuro-optometric evaluation is recommended to identify visual dysfunctions and provide appropriate management options.

Hypothesis/Objectives To describe the neurological and computed tomographic (CT) features of a large cohort of dogs and cats with TSF. Animals Ninety-one dogs and 95 cats with TSF identified on CT. Methods Multicenter retrospective comparative study. Signalment, cause of trauma, fracture locations and characteristics, presence of neurological deficits, and 1-week survival were recorded. Fractures were classified according to the extent of fragmentation and displacement. Results The cranial vault was affected more frequently in dogs (P= .003), whereas the face and base of the cranium more often was affected in cats (P < .001). Cats presented with multiple fractures more frequently (P < .001). All animals with TSF in the cranial vault were more likely to develop neurological signs (P= .02), especially when depressed fractures were present (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-8.2;P= .001). Animals with TSF located only in the facial region were less likely to have neurological signs (odds ratio with Mantel-Haenszel's method [ORMH], 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6;P= .004). Most affected animals (84.9%) survived the first week post-trauma. Death was more likely with fractures of the cranial vault (P= .003), especially when fragmented (P= .007) and displaced (P= .004). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Traumatic skull fracture distribution and patterns are different between dogs and cats. Cranial vault fractures were associated with neurological deficits and worse survival. The presence of TSF alone should not be considered a negative prognostic factor because most affected animals survived the first week.

The present study evaluated activity of PP-4-one against mTOR signaling activation in a rat model of FeCl2-induced post-traumatic epilepsy. Material/Methods: Epilepsy in rats was induced by injecting 10 mu l FeCl2 (concentration 100 mM) at a uniform rate of 1 mu l/minute. The iNOS expression was detected using a Leica microscope connected to a digital camera system. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for determination of NR1 mRNA expression. Results: The post-traumatic epilepsy induced neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the rats. Treatment with PP-4-one prevented neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in rats with post-traumatic epilepsy. The data revealed markedly higher levels of p-mTOR and p-P70S6K in rat hippocampal tissues after induction of traumatic epilepsy. Treatment of post-traumatic epilepsy rats with PP-4-one significantly suppressed p-mTOR and p-P70S6K expression, and PP-4-one treatment reduced epileptic brain injury in the rats with post-traumatic epilepsy. Conclusions: PP-4-one exhibits an anti-epileptogenic effect in the rat model of PTE by inhibiting behavioral seizures through suppression of iNOS and astrocytic proliferation. Moreover, PP-4-one treatment suppressed NR1 expression and targeted the mTOR pathway in PTE-induced rats. Thus, PP-4-one shows promise as a novel and effective therapeutic agent for treatment of epilepsy induced by PTE.

Bigger Necks Are Not Enough: An Examination of Neck Circumference in Incoming College Athletes	JOURNAL OF PRIMARY PREVENTION			English	Article						Concussion; Athletes; Sex differences; Neck circumference	SEX-DIFFERENCES; HEAD ACCELERATION; CONCUSSION; AGE	Neck circumference is quick and simple to measure and thus an attractive proxy of neck strength, a putative mechanism underlying risk of sport-related concussion (SRC). Research, however, is limited on the relationship of neck circumference to SRC. Our study examined differences in neck circumference based on sex, concussion history, concussions experienced subsequent to college entry, and participation in sports with high versus low risk for contact. Neck circumference was measured in incoming NCAA Division I athletes (N = 324) from a large northeastern university during athlete pre-participation physicals. Sex, sport team, and self-reported concussion history were obtained from retrospective pre-participation questionnaires and medical chart review. Concussion diagnoses during college were collected subsequent to neck measurements from medical chart review. Proportional neck circumference (normalized by body mass index) was computed. Each sport was categorized as involving high or low risk of contact (as a proxy of risk for injury). Sex differences in neck circumference and proportional neck circumference were assessed. Differences in neck circumference and proportional neck circumference were also characterized by contact risk and SRC history (with biological sex included as a covariate). Differences in neck circumference and proportional neck circumference were explored among those who did versus did not experience subsequent SRC diagnosis. Males had significantly larger neck circumference and proportional neck circumference than females. Neck circumference and proportional neck circumference were not related to SRC history or subsequent SRC. Neck circumference is a quick and simple measure; however, even when considered in proportion to body mass, it was unrelated to SRC. Future studies are needed to assess whether this is due to a lack of relationship between the neck and injury or limitations in circumference as a proxy measure of cervical spine characteristics and biomechanics.

In this study, we investigated the dynamic deformation of the brain stem, which might be important for these symptoms, using a human brain finite element model through reconstruction simulations of rear-end collisions in three different velocities. In all simulations, high maximum principal strain values were observed at the midbrain that were higher than those in the corpus callosum. These findings could provide some mechanical insights into brain disorders associated with mild TBI.

J	Doig, EJ; Fleming, J; Ownsworth, T				Doig, Emmah J.; Fleming, Jennifer; Ownsworth, Tamara			Evaluation of an occupation-based metacognitive intervention targeting awareness, executive function and goal-related outcomes after traumatic brain injury using single-case experimental design methodology	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Metacognition; awareness; meaningful occupation; goals; rehabilitation	IMPAIRED SELF-AWARENESS; NORMATIVE DATA; CLINICAL UTILITY; PERFORMANCE; REHABILITATION; DEFICITS; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; FEEDBACK; FLUENCY	Self-awareness is commonly impaired after traumatic brain injury and impacts on rehabilitation engagement and community re-integration outcomes. Interventions which incorporate metacognitive strategy instruction have the potential to improve rehabilitation engagement and outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether an occupation-based intervention incorporating metacognitive strategy instruction resulted in goal achievement and improved online awareness and executive function performance during goal-related tasks. A single-case experimental design using a multiple-baseline design across behaviours was used with two participants with severe traumatic brain injury to evaluate the effectiveness of the 6-week intervention. Repeated measures of goal-related performance, percentage of self-corrected errors and executive function were made via independent analysis of video footage and documentation logs. Data analysis involved 2SD bandwidth analysis and overlap data, reliable change index and evaluation of goal achievement across phases. There were improvements in self-corrected errors for one participant, which were maintained. Significant reductions in anxiety (RCI = +/- 5.98) were evident for both participants, with a significant reduction in stress (RCI = +/- 7.05) for one participant following the intervention. The occupation-based intervention incorporating metacognitive strategy instruction led to improvements compared to baseline performance in some targeted goals, online awareness and executive function performance during goal-related tasks and reduced stress and anxiety.

Methods This was a prospective, non-randomized, interventional clinical trial that involved five patients with severe traumatic brain injury. The intervention consisted of inducing and maintaining selective brain cooling for 24 h by positioning a catheter in the nasopharynx and circulating cold water inside the catheter in a closed-loop arrangement. Core temperature was maintained at >= 35 degrees C using counter-warming. Results In all study participants, a brain temperature reduction of >= 2 degrees C was achieved. The mean brain temperature reduction from baseline was 2.5 +/- 0.9 degrees C (P = .04, 95% confidence interval). The mean systemic temperature was 37.3 +/- 1.1 degrees C at baseline and 36.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C during the intervention. The mean difference between the brain temperature and the systemic temperature during intervention was - 1.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C (P = .04). The intervention was well tolerated with no significant changes observed in the hemodynamic parameters. No relevant variations in intracranial pressure and transcranial Doppler were observed. The laboratory results underwent no major changes, aside from the K(+)levels and blood counts. The K(+)levels significantly varied (P = .04); however, the variation was within the normal range. Only one patient experienced an event of mild localized and superficial nasal discoloration, which was re-evaluated on the seventh day and indicated complete recovery. Conclusion The results suggest that our noninvasive method for selective brain cooling, using a novel nasopharyngeal catheter, was effective and safe for use in humans.

J	Ganpule, S; Sutar, S; Shinde, K				Ganpule, Shailesh; Sutar, Sunil; Shinde, Kaustaubh			Biomechanical Analysis of Woodpecker Response During Pecking Using a Two-Dimensional Computational Model	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						woodpecker; human; pecking; impact biomechanics; brain injury; scaling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; AXONAL DAMAGE; BRAIN-INJURY; HEAD; SPORTS; TISSUE; STRAIN	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to the impact is a critical health concern. Impact mitigation strategy is a vital design paradigm to reduce the burden of TBI and CTE. In this regard, woodpecker biomimicry continues to attract attention. However, a direct comparison between a woodpecker and human biomechanical responses is lacking. Toward this end, we investigate the biomechanical response of a woodpecker during pecking using a two-dimensional head model. We also analyze the response of concurrent human head model to facilitate direct comparison with woodpecker response. The head models of woodpecker and human were built from medical images, the material properties were adopted from the literature. Both woodpecker and human head models were subjected to head kinematics obtained during pecking and resulting biomechanical response is studied. For the pecking cycle simulated in this work, peak rotational velocity and acceleration were similar to 15 rad/s and 7,057 rad/s(2). These peak values are commensurate with the kinematics threshold values reported in human TBI. Our results show that, for the same input acceleration, the strains and stresses in the woodpecker brain are approximately six times lower than that of the human brain. The stress reduction is mainly attributed to the smaller size of the woodpecker head. The effect of pecking frequency and multiple pecking cycles have also been studied. It is observed that the strains and stresses in the brain are increased by similar to 100% as pecking frequency is doubled. During multiple pecking cycle, dwell period of similar to 90 ms tend to relax the stresses in the woodpecker brain; however, the amount of relaxation depends on the value of the decay constant. The comparison of biomechanical response against the axonal injury threshold suggests that for peak rotational acceleration of 7,057 rad/s(2)the maximum principal strain in the brains of woodpecker and human exceed the threshold limit. Acceleration scaling relationship between a woodpecker and equivalent human response is also developed as a function of head size. We obtain a scaling factor,ahaw, of 0.11 for baseline head sizes and a scaling factor of 1.03 as the human head size approaches woodpecker head size.

Methods Cycling organizations sent members a web link to online information about the study and a questionnaire. Anyone aged >16 years, living in New Zealand and engaged in a cycling activity was invited to participate. The 36-item questionnaire included sociodemographics, knowledge about concussion, helmet use, and personal concussion history. Data were collected between 15/05/19 and 30/06/19. A multiple linear regression model identified factors associated with levels of concussion knowledge. Results The questionnaire was completed by 672 participants aged between 16 and 82 years (x & x304; = 48.6 years). Knowledge of concussion was high. However, knowledge that helmets are not able to prevent concussion was low and time to return to sport after injury was variable. Knowledge did not always translate to seeking of medical attention or replacement of helmet behavior. Younger age and having sustained at least one prior concussion were associated with higher levels of concussion knowledge F(df = 3) = 8.81,pConclusions Knowledge and attitudes toward concussion were positive. However, knowledge gaps and discrepancies between attitudes and behavior were identified. Consistent, clear messages are needed around return to sport timeframes.

Developing Cognition Endpoints for the CENTER-TBI Neuropsychological Test Battery	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						brain concussion; brain injury; cognition; neuropsychology; psychometrics	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPORTS CONCUSSION; IMPAIRMENT; SCORES; OUTCOMES; RESERVE; ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS; VALIDITY	Background:Measuring cognitive functioning is common in traumatic brain injury (TBI) research, but no universally accepted method for combining several neuropsychological test scores into composite, or summary, scores exists. This study examined several possible composite scores for the test battery used in the large-scale study Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI). Methods:Participants with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI;n= 140), orthopedic trauma (n= 72), and healthy community controls (n= 70) from the Trondheim MTBI follow-up study completed the CENTER-TBI test battery at 2 weeks after injury, which includes both traditional paper-and-pencil tests and tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Seven composite scores were calculated for the paper and pencil tests, the CANTAB tests, and all tests combined (i.e., 21 composites): the overall test battery mean (OTBM); global deficit score (GDS); neuropsychological deficit score-weighted (NDS-W); low score composite (LSC); and the number of scores <= 5th percentile, <= 16th percentile, or Results:The OTBM and the number of scores <50th percentile composites had distributional characteristics approaching a normal distribution. The other composites were in general highly skewed and zero-inflated. When the MTBI group, the trauma control group, and the community control group were compared, effect sizes were negligible to small for all composites. Subgroups with vs. without loss of consciousness at the time of injury did not differ on the composite scores and neither did subgroups with complicated vs. uncomplicated MTBIs. Intercorrelations were highwithinthe paper-and-pencil composites, the CANTAB composites, and the combined composites and lowerbetweenthe paper-and-pencil composites and the CANTAB composites. Conclusion:None of the composites revealed significant differences between participants with MTBI and the two control groups. Some of the composite scores were highly correlated and may be redundant. Additional research on patients with moderate to severe TBIs is needed to determine which scores are most appropriate for TBI clinical trials.

Transcranial low-frequency pulsating electromagnetic fields (T-PEMF) as post-concussion syndrome treatment	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						concussion; electromagnetic stimulation; mTBI; PCS; post-concussion syndrome; T-PEMF	BRAIN-INJURY; AUGMENTATION	Background Treatment options for the subgroup of people who develop long-lasting symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury are limited. Transcranial pulsating low-frequency electromagnetic stimulation (T-PEMF) in other patient groups has shown promising results in several studies with proposed neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Objective The present pilot study was conducted to access feasibility and tolerability of T-PEMF in treating post-concussion syndrome. Methods Seven patients with post-concussion syndrome received 5 weeks of daily 30 minutes T-PEMF treatment with evaluation after 2 and 5 weeks and 3 months after ending treatment. Results Compliance was high as all subject completed the full treatment. Two patients however experienced a worsening of their concussion symptoms during the course of treatment. The remaining patients had some discomfort in relation to treatment, mainly headache, but passing and less for each treatment. The majority (n = 5) had a reduction in symptoms overall, up to 61% (2%-61%) based on the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. Conclusion Further studies on T-PEMF as a treatment option for post-concussion syndrome are warranted.

Method: Multiple regression analyzes taking into account age, education, and gender were used to generate the normative data. Results: Age and education were significantly related to test performance such that scores decreased with age and improved as a function of education. An online calculator is provided to generate normative test scores. Conclusions: This is the first study that presents normative data for tests of executive functions and attention in an Ecuadorian adult population. This data will improve the clinical practice of neuropsychology and help to develop the field in the country.

Matrix Deformation with Ectopic Cells Induced by Rotational Motion in Bioengineered Neural Tissues	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tissue engineering; Extracellular matrix; Microtearing; Ectopic cells; Cortical neurons	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; WHOLE-BODY VIBRATION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; LESIONS; STIFFNESS; RIGIDITY; ADULT; MODEL	The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic protein-based scaffold within which neural networks can form, self-maintain, and re-model. When the brain incurs injuries, microscopic tissue tears and active ECM re-modelling give way to abnormal brain structure and function including the presence of ectopic cells. Post-mortem and neuroimaging data suggest that the brains of jet pilots and astronauts, who are exposed to rotational forces, accelerations, and microgravity, display brain anomalies which could be indicative of a mechanodisruptive pathology. Here we present a model of non-impact-based brain injury induced by matrix deformation following mechanical shaking. Using a bioengineered 3D neural tissue platform, we designed a repetitive shaking paradigm to simulate subtle rotational acceleration. Our results indicate shaking induced ectopic cell clustering that could be inhibited by physically restraining tissue movement. Imaging revealed that the collagen substrate surrounding cells was deformed following shaking. Applied to neonatal rat brains, shaking induced deformation of extracellular spaces within the cerebral cortices and reduced the number of cell bodies at higher accelerations. We hypothesize that ECM deformation may represent a more significant role in brain injury progression than previously assumed and that the present model system contributes to its understanding as a phenomenon.

The center of pressure (COP) displacement amplitude, cadence, and error percentage (PER) were recorded as dependent variables.Results: The results revealed main effects of Group (TBI, controls) (p= .011) and Task factors (Single, Dual Standing 1-back, Dual Standing 1-back (S);p= .0001) for the COP. Patients showed greater displacement than controls (p= .011), and an analysis of the Task factor showed a minor displacement for the dual 1-back (S) task compared with the 1-back and single task (p= .002 andp= .001, respectively).Conclusions: Postural control during both standing and walking improved during performance of the spatial working memory task. In the dual task, both patients and controls showed a postural prioritization as an adaptive response to the increase in cognitive demand.

J	Liu, C; He, DQ; Zhao, QM				Liu, Cai; He, Dongqiang; Zhao, Qiming			Licoricidin improves neurological dysfunction after traumatic brain injury in mice via regulating FoxO3/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway	JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES			English	Article						Licoricidin; Traumatic brain injury; Oxidative stress; Apoptosis; FoxO3; Wnt; beta-catenin pathway	OXIDATIVE STRESS; BETA-CATENIN; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; SYNAPTIC PROTEINS; CYCLE ARREST; APOPTOSIS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; CELLS; NEUROPROTECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability around the world with no effective treatments currently. The present study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of licoricidin, one of the major components of licorice extract, on TBI mice and further explore the underlying mechanism. Male C57BL/6 mice were modeled by a modified weight-drop method to mimic TBI. All animals received treatment 30 min after TBI. The modified Neurological Severity Score (NSS) tests were performed at 2 h and 1-3 days after TBI. The brain edema was analyzed by dry-wet weight method. The malonaldehyde (MDA) levels and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined by Elisa. Apoptotic neurons were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) immunofluorescence and the expression of apoptotic proteins were measured by western blot. Activation of the FoxO3/Wnt/beta-catenin was evaluated by western blot. The results showed that treatment with licoricidin could significantly decline the NSS scores and reduce the brain edema, hence promote the recovery of neurological function in TBI mice. It also elevated the phosphorylation of p66(shc), brought down the levels of MDA, as well as antagonized the decrement in activities of GSH-PX, SOD and CAT induced by TBI. Moreover, licoricidin decreased the TUNEL positive neurons, downregulated the expression of Cyt-C, cleaved-Caspase-3, cleaved-Caspase-9 and Bax and upregulated the Bcl-2, attenuated cellular apoptosis. Licoricidin decreased the expression of FoxO3 and increased the Wnt/beta-catenin in TBI mice. In conclusion, Licoricidin exerted neuroprotective effect on TBI model and the effect was possibly due to its antioxidative effect and antiapoptotic effect via regulating the FoxO3/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

CUREUS			English	Article						tbi; levetiracetam; seizure; gcs; keppra	PHENYTOIN; MULTICENTER; ADULTS	Background Antiepileptic agents are recommended to prevent early post-traumatic seizures (PTS) within seven days of injury in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). These agents are not routinely recommended for patients with mild-to-moderate TBI, defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score > 8. At St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, levetiracetam (LEV) is commonly prescribed to prevent PTS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of LEV use in patients with mild, moderate, and severe TBI. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated the use of LEV in adult patients admitted with TBI over a five-year period. Patients who were younger than 18 years, had a history of seizures, were transferred to a tertiary center, or succumbed to their injuries were excluded. The primary outcome was appropriateness of LEV use. Secondary outcomes included duration of LEV treatment and rate of seizures. Results Of the 448 patients evaluated, 36 patients were excluded. Of the 412 included patients, 403 (97.8%) had a non-severe TBI, defined as GCS score > 8. In patients with non-severe TBI, 153 (38%) received LEV and 94 (23.3%) received LEV for more than seven days. Additionally, 105 (26.1%) patients with non-severe TBI were discharged with a prescription for LEV despite not having a seizure during hospitalization. All six patients with non-severe TBI who experienced a seizure were receiving LEV. Conclusions Inappropriate use of LEV is common in patients admitted with non-severe TBI, with many patients continuing LEV post-discharge. With careful patient selection, patients with mild and moderate TBI likely do not need seizure prophylaxis with LEV. Education on appropriate indication and duration of LEV in patients with TBI is warranted.

We provide a case of a patient with typical corpus callosum syndrome following a traumatic brain injury, and demonstrate neural reorganization and significant neural regeneration after comprehensive rehabilitation, using diffusion tensor imaging fiber bundle tracking. Patient concerns: We found typical clinical manifestations of damage to the corpus callosum. Diagnoses, Interventions, and Outcomes: We diagnosed a Traumatic Brain Injury (diffuse axonal injury and rupture of corpus callosum). The patient underwent a comprehensive multifaceted rehabilitation program including drug therapy, integrated physical therapy, occupational therapy, acupuncture, music therapy, computer-aided cognitive rehabilitation training, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This rehabilitation program resulted in greatly improved physical and communication ability. Lessons: Comprehensive rehabilitation can significantly improve the function of patients with corpus callosum syndrome and may cause neural remodeling, as seen on diffusion tensor imaging.

However, the EVD weaning trial protocol varies and insufficient studies focus on the intracranial pressure (ICP) during the weaning trial. We aimed to establish the relationship between ICP during an EVD weaning trial and the outcomes of TBI. We enrolled 37 patients with a TBI with an EVD from July 2018 to September 2019. Among them, 26 were allocated to the favorable outcome group and 11 to the unfavorable outcome group (death, post-traumatic hydrocephalus, persistent vegetative state, and severe disability). Groups were well matched for sex, pupil reactivity, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, Marshall computed tomography score, modified Fisher score, intraventricular hemorrhage, EVD days, cerebrospinal fluid output before the weaning trial, and the complications. Before and during the weaning trial, we recorded the ICP at 1-hour intervals to calculate the mean ICP, delta ICP, and ICP burden, which was defined as the area under the ICP curve. There were significant between-group differences in the age, surgery types, and intensive care unit days (p=0.045,p=0.028, andp=0.004, respectively). During the weaning trial, 28 (75.7%) patients had an increased ICP. Although there was no significant difference in the mean ICP before and during the weaning trial, the delta ICP was higher in the unfavorable outcome group (p=0.001). Moreover, patients who experienced death and hydrocephalus had a higher ICP burden, which was above 20 mmHg (p=0.016). Receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated the predictive ability of these variables (area under the curveAUC=0.818[p=0.002] for delta ICP andAUC=0.758[p=0.038] forICP burden>20 mmHg). ICP elevation is common during EVD weaning trials in patients with TBI. ICP-related parameters, including delta ICP and ICP burden, are significant outcome predictors. There is a need for larger prospective studies to further explore the relationship between ICP during EVD weaning trials and TBI outcomes.

J	Ladowsky-Brooks, RL; Chan, A				Ladowsky-Brooks, Ricki L.; Chan, Albert			Measures of figural fluency: Relationship to neuropsychological variables and traumatic brain injury severity	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT			English	Article; Early Access						Ruff Figural Fluency Test; design fluency; executive functioning; perseveration	DESIGN FLUENCY; VERBAL FLUENCY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; RELIABILITY; EDUCATION; CORTEX; FAS	Figural fluency tests were originally developed as a measure of right frontal lobe integrity and are presently a standard component of neuropsychological evaluation. To better understand the clinical interpretation of figural fluency scores (design output and perseverative errors), the current study investigated two trials from the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT) and their correlations with other neuropsychological variables in examinees who were being evaluated for cognitive difficulties (N = 84). Design output was significantly correlated (r(s)> .4) with psychomotor speed, non-verbal memory, and false positive recognition errors on a verbal memory test, while perseverative errors did not show a significant correlation with these variables or with design output. Design output also showed a significant correlation with phonemic fluency (r(s)> .3) as well as correlations (r(s)> .25) with semantic fluency and intellectual functioning. In a sample of examinees with mild (n = 33), complicated-mild (n = 11), and moderate-severe (n = 16) traumatic brain injuries (TBI), group differences in design output did not reach significance, whereas perseverative errors were significantly related to the severity of injury. This study suggests that design output and perseverative errors on figural fluency may be separate measures, and their clinical interpretations are discussed.

Evaluate reliability and construct validity of the newly-developed Family Needs Questionnaire - Pediatric (FNQ-P), a 40-item measure assessing the extent to which family's needs are met after a child has an acquired brain injury (ABI). 2) Explore the impact of selected child characteristics on FNQ-P scores. Research Design: Measurement study Methods: Parents/caregivers of children with ABI (2-18 years) were recruited across four sites (Canada, Sweden, Lithuania, Australia) for FNQ-P test-retest evaluation. These sites plus a fifth (United Kingdom) completed construct validity evaluation with the Family Burden of Injury Inventory and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Associations between FNQ-P score and age, injury severity, time post-injury and site were evaluated via stepwise regression. Results FNQ-P mean scores (n=61) were 64.1% (SD 22.3) and 58.8% (SD 22.6) on test and retest, respectively. Test-retest reliability was good overall (ICC=0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.86). There was a weak association between FNQ-P and FBII (r=-0.23,P=0.049, n=71), but no association between FNQ-P and SDQ scores (maximum r=0.16,P>0.15). None of the variables studied predicted FNQ-P scores. Conclusion The FNQ-P demonstrated good test-retest reliability. Further validity assessment is recommended. Lack of relationship between FNQ-P and variables studied suggests independence of family needs.	[Gan, Caron; Wright, F.

Close Reduction Technique for Severely Displaced Radial Neck Fractures in Children	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Radial neck fracture; Severe; Close reduction; Judet IV	HEAD	Introduction Radial neck fractures account for 5-10% of paediatric elbow trauma. Radial neck fractures have been classified by Judet into five types (I-IVb). There is a global agreement to reduce radial neck fractures with angulation more than 30 degrees (Type III, IVa and IVb). Various maneuvers have been described but none of them uniformly achieved complete reduction in severely displaced radial neck fractures (Type IVa and Type IVb Judet). In this case series, we are presenting our experience with close reduction of ten severely displaced paediatric radial neck fractures to achieve complete anatomical reduction. Methods We attempted close reduction in ten consecutive children with average age of 8.59 +/- 1.68 years (range, 6-12 years) who presented with severely displaced radial neck fracture (Type IVa and IVb Judet). There were five girls. All patients had close injuries and presented to us within 24-48 h. One of the patients had associated undisplaced lateral condyle fracture. We have excluded two patients with associated elbow dislocation. Close reduction was performed within 48 h of initial injury. Results We were able to obtain complete anatomical reduction in all of our patients with this technique. None of the patients required fixation of fracture. At 1 year of follow-up, (12 +/- 2.07 months, range 9-16 months) all patients demonstrated almost full range of elbow and forearm motion. Final radiographs revealed complete union without any evidence of avascular necrosis. Conclusion This technique offers an option of close reduction for the most severely displaced radial neck fractures, which were otherwise being treated by surgical intervention.

Endocrine Dysfunction Following Stroke	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNE PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Endocrine dysfunction; Hemorrhagic stroke; Ischemic stroke; Pituitary	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; PITUITARY DYSFUNCTION; HYPOPITUITARISM; INSUFFICIENCY; HORMONE; RISK	Endocrine dysfunction is known to occur after traumatic brain injury. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of various endocrine dysfunctions after a stroke. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was searched from 2001 to 2011 for patients with a diagnosis of stroke. Stroke patients were matched by diagnosis date, age, and sex to patients without a stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to compare the incidence of goiter, acquired hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, pituitary dysfunction, and disorders of the adrenal glands between stroke and non-stroke patients. There were 131,951 patients in the stroke group, and 131,951 in the matched non- stroke group (mean age 66.1 +/- 14.9 years). Stroke patients had significantly higher risk of acquired hypothyroidism (crude hazard ratio [cHR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44, 1.90; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.42, 1.91), pituitary dysfunction (cHR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.79, 2.99; aHR =1.92, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.52), and disorders of the adrenal glands (cHR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.52, 2.12; aHR =1.62, 95% CI: 1.36, 1.92) than non-stroke patients. Pituitary dysfunction and disorders of the adrenal glands were found in both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke patients, while hypothyroidism was seen in ischemic stroke patients only. No significant association was found for goiter and thyroiditis. In conclusions, stroke survivors have an approximately 2-fold increased risk of developing acquired hypothyroidism, pituitary dysfunction, or disorders of the adrenal glands. These risks should be taken into account in the management of patients who have ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes.

Using 266,586 eligible records, LCA resulted in two classes of hospitalizations, namely, class I (n=217,988) (mostly non-surgical) and class II (n=48,598) (mostly surgical). Whereas orthopedic procedures were equally likely among latent classes, skin-related, physical medicine and rehabilitation procedures as well as behavioral health procedures were more likely among class I, and other types of procedures were more likely among class II. Class II patients were more likely to have moderate-to-severe TBI, to be admitted on weekends, to urban, medium-to-large hospitals in Midwestern, Southern or Western regions, and less likely to be>30 years, female or non-White. Class II patients were also less likely to be discharged home and necessitated longer hospital stays and greater hospitalization charges. Surgery appears to distinguish two classes of hospitalized patients with TBI with divergent healthcare needs, informing the planning of healthcare services in this target population.

We report the association of demographic, radiographic, and injury characteristics with outcome parameters in early (<24 h) and late (>= 24 h) decompressive craniectomy following traumatic brain injury. Methods We retrospectively identified 204 patients (158 (early decompressive craniectomy) and 46 (late decompressive craniectomy)), with a median age of 34 years (range 2-78 years) between 2015 and 2018. The primary endpoint was Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 60 days, while secondary endpoints included Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at discharge, mortality at 30 days, and length of hospital stay. Regression analysis was used to assess the independent predictive variables of functional outcome. Results With a clinical follow-up of 60 days, the good functional outcome (GOSE = 5-8) was 73.5% versus 74.1% (p = 0.75) in early and late decompressive craniectomy, respectively. GCS >= 9 at discharge was 82.2% versus 91.3% (p = 0.21), mortality at 30 days was 10.8% versus 8.7% (p = 0.39), and length of stay in the hospital was 21 days versus 28 days (p = 0.20), respectively, in early and late decompressive craniectomy groups. Univariate analysis identified that GCS at admission (0.07 (0.32-0.18; < 0.05)) and indication for decompressive craniectomy (3.7 (1.3-11.01; 0.01)) are significantly associated with good functional outcome. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that GCS at admission (<9/>= 9) (0.07 (0.03-0.16; <0.05)) and indication for decompressive craniectomy (extradural alone/ other hematoma) (1.75 (1.09-3.25; 0.02)) were significant independent predictors of good functional outcome irrespective of the timing of surgery. Conclusions Our results corroborate that the timing of surgery does not affect the outcome parameters. Furthermore, GCS >= 9 and/or extra dural hematoma are associated with relatively good clinical outcome after decompressive craniectomy.

The factor structure of the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) following traumatic brain injury	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Subjective quality of life; Confirmatory factor analysis; Quality of Life Inventory; Clinical outcome	FIT INDEXES; HEALTH; SATISFACTION; DOMAINS; WORK; REHABILITATION; PARTICIPATION; INTERVENTION; INDIVIDUALS; ADJUSTMENT	Quality of life is a key indicator of outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research has reported several different factor structures for the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI, Frisch, 1994). We compared the fit of existing factor models and examined the clinical utility of the QOLI's factors in a sample of Australian adults with TBI. Archival data from 901 participants were provided by the Neurotrauma Register of Tasmania. Participants were aged 16-80 years and 63% were male. Approximately 69% had mild TBI (PTA < 24 h), approximately 24% had moderate TBI (PTA >1 day, <7 days) and 7% had severe TBI. Both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses were utilized, as participants provided data at one or more of seven time-points, up to 3 years following injury. The results showed the data best fitted a three-factor model, comprising Self-functioning and activity, Self-actualization and Family and environment factors, and a second order Overall QOL factor. Differences in the trajectory of recovery were noted between the QOLI factor scores over time and in relation to demographic and injury variables. In conclusion, the three-factor structure of the QOLI provided useful clinical information about the recovery of patients' subjective quality of life following TBI.	[Troup, G. A.; Thomas, M.

Investigating the effects of impact directions on improving head injury index	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Brain injury; Computational modeling; Finite element method; Injury criteria; Safety	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURIES; MILD; PREDICTORS; RISK; ACCELERATIONS; KINEMATICS; FOOTBALL	Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the most important causes of death and disability. The objective of this study was to develop new Head Injury Criteria (IIIC), which could predict the Maximum Principal Strain (MPS) and shear stress in the brain considering the impact directions and magnitudes. Accordingly, 150 head impact simulations were performed with three magnitudes and 50 directions of impact using head Finite Element Model (FEM). Simulations were performed in order to assess the strain and shear stress in the brain tissues due to different impact directions and magnitudes. Next, new HIC were developed through performing statistical analysis. The simulation results showed that TBI risks in the sagittal and frontal planes were higher than those in transverse plane. Furthermore, new brain injury indices were developed to predict MPS and shear stress in the brain, which had correlation coefficients of 0.85 and 0.89 with the head FEM responses, respectively. The findings of the present research showed the effects of impact directions on TBI risks. They also demonstrated that impact magnitude, direction, and duration should be used to develop a brain injury index. (C) 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

Antiplatelet Agent Reversal Is Unnecessary in Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Patients Not Requiring Immediate Craniotomy	AMERICAN SURGEON			English	Article						Antiplatelet agent reversal; blunt traumatic brain injury; platelet transfusion		Background The need to reverse the coagulation impairment caused by chronic antiplatelet agents in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with acute traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (TICH) remains controversial. We sought to determine whether emergent platelet transfusion reduces the incidence of hemorrhage expansion, mortality, or need for neurosurgical intervention such as intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, burr holes, or craniotomy. Methods All adult blunt TICH patients (age >= 16 years) over a 4-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with penetrating TBI, blunt TBI without TICH on admission computed tomography (CT), receiving warfarin, not on antiplatelet agents, or requiring immediate operative intervention were excluded. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether they received a platelet transfusion: reversal group (RV) versus no reversal group (NR). Patient outcomes were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests. Results 169 blunt TBI patients on chronic antiplatelet therapy were studied (102 RV group, 67 NR group). The groups were well matched with regard to age, Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale-head, Glasgow Coma Score, mechanism of injury, need for intubation, time to initial CT scan, and hospital length of stay. Immediate platelet transfusion did not alter the occurrence of TICH extension on follow-up CT (26% vs 21%, P = .71), TBI-specific mortality (9% vs 13%, P = .45), need for ICP monitor (2% vs 3%, P = 1.0), burr hole (1% vs 3%, P = .56), or craniotomy (1% vs 3%, P = .56). Discussion Immediate platelet transfusion is unnecessary in blunt TBI patients on chronic antiplatelet therapy who do not require immediate craniotomy.

Although rare, it is most commonly seen in paediatric cases. There have been three previously documented cases in adults, all requiring surgery and associated with ulnohumeral dislocations. Two of our cases required operative intervention, whilst one was reduced closed and did not require stabilisation. Furthermore, we have for the first time shown that proximal radioulnar translocations can occur in isolation in adults without an ulnohumeral dislocation.Level of evidenceLevel IV.

Objectives: This study aimed to reveal some molecular aspects of spreading depolarization and suggesting new therapeutic targets for its control by changing the function of different astrocytic and neuronal ion channels. Methods: The effects of nortriptyline on spreading depolarization in cortical and hippocampal tissues and on the electrophysiological properties of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were assessed by extra- and intracellular recording, following washing rat brain slices by the drug. Results: Nortriptyline made a significant increase in the amplitude of spreading depolarization in cortical and hippocampal tissues relative to control but did not change the duration significantly in each of the tissues. No significant difference was found in the effects of spreading depolarization on the electrophysiological properties of the CA1 pyramidal neurons between nortriptyline and control groups. Conclusions: The stimulating effect of nortriptyline on spreading depolarization is probably related to the augmentation of extracellular potassium collection in the cortex and hippocampus due to inhibition of astrocytic potassium scavenging function. This change can make more neurons prone to depolarization and increase the overall amplitude of spreading depolarization waves.

J	Belanger, HG				Belanger, Heather G.			Introduction to a special issue on military neuropsychology: Serving those who serve	CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						Concussion; CTE; military; neuropsychological assessment; mild TBI; rehabilitation		Objective:The military has a long history with neuropsychology and its precursors. From developing intelligence tests during World War I, to developing early capacity and personality assessments during World War II, to forward deploying for the evaluation and treatment of frequent concussive brain injuries during more recent conflicts, clinical neuropsychology has been at the forefront of military selection, healthcare and research. The objective of this special issue is to provide an overview of the latest clinical research relevant to military neuropsychology-some contributors address assessment and treatment issues that are relevant to current practice and others foretell the future of our field. Method:We solicited papers from established researchers and issued a general call for papers for the special issue on military neuropsychology. Results: We received submissions from several authors, eleven of which are included in this issue. These submissions cover assessment and treatment issues, as well as healthcare utilization and return to duty issues. Two apparent themes are the importance of assessing, treating, and attending to comorbidities following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and future assessment techniques moving beyond traditional cognitive performance assessment. Conclusions:The issue highlights the importance of research in clinical neuropsychology to the practice and advancement of military neuropsychology.

J	Bruce, SL; Dorney, K				Bruce, Scott L.; Dorney, Kyra			Posturing Responses in Concussions Sustained by Elite American Football Players	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC THERAPY & TRAINING			English	Article						fencing posturing; loss of consciousness; video analysis	SAFE RETURN; HIGH-SCHOOL; SPORT; CONVULSIONS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; RECOVERY	Current literature indicates loss of consciousness occurs in about 10% of concussions. Posturing presentations represent brain injuries and a loss of consciousness. The purpose of this study was to observe video evidence of football-game-related concussions to determine the rate in which a posturing presentation occurs in reported concussion. Over the course of three National Football League and three National Collegiate Athletic Association football seasons, 103 videos of 805 reported concussions met the inclusion criteria; 35 videos demonstrated a posturing presentation, for a rate of 33.98%. Our study indicates that the published statistic regarding loss of consciousness (occurring only about 10% of the time) may be too conservative.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Italian athletes. Participants: We recruited 324 athletes (215 men, 109 women) divided in two samples: 101 injured athletes returning to their first competition following injury, 223 non-injured athletes making their first competition of the regular season. Main outcome measures: The AQ-RARC-IT, the Psychobiosocial States Scale (PBS-ST), and a Concentration Disruption scale. Athletes completed the questionnaires at the end of their first competition. We investigated the construct validity, the internal consistency, and the concurrent validity of all measures. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the two-factor structure of the AQ-RARC-IT yielding acceptable fit indices, CFI = 0.930, TLI = 0.912, RMSEA (90% CI) = 0.100 (.076-A23), and SRMR = 0.082. Concurrent validity was evaluated through Pearson's correlation coefficients between measures. Correlations ranged in magnitude from weak to moderately high. Conclusions: Study findings showed satisfactory psychometric properties of the AQ-RARC-IT. The questionnaire can be used for clinical and research purposes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Early Aerobic Exercise for the Treatment of Acute Pediatric Concussions	JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING			English	Article							POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME; ACTIVE REHABILITATION; CHILDREN; INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; VOLUNTARY; MEDICINE	Sport-related concussion is a common injury that has garnered the attention of the media and general public because of the potential for prolonged acute symptoms and increased risk for long-term impairment. Currently, a growing body of evidence supports the use of various therapies to improve recovery after a concussion. A contemporary approach to managing concussion symptoms is to use aerobic exercise as treatment. To date, several studies on both pediatric and adult patients have established that controlled aerobic exercise is a safe and effective way to rehabilitate patients experiencing delayed recovery after concussion. However, less is known about the utility of an early exercise protocol for optimizing recovery after acute concussion and reducing the risk for persistent postconcussive symptoms, particularly in pediatric populations. Thus, the purpose of our paper was to review and evaluate the available literature on the implementation of aerobic exercise for the treatment of acute pediatric concussion.

Validation of the Surgical Intervention for Traumatic Injury scale in the pediatric population	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; decompressive hemicraniectomy; neurotrauma; Glasgow Coma Scale; trauma	GLASGOW COMA SCALE; BRAIN-INJURY; SCORE; MORTALITY; IMPACT; MODELS	OBJECTIVE While the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been effective in describing severity in traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is no current method for communicating the possible need for surgical intervention. This study utilizes a recently developed scoring system, the Surgical Intervention for Traumatic Injury (SITI) scale, which was developed to efficiently communicate the potential need for surgical decompression in adult patients with TBI. The objective of this study was to apply the SITI scale to a pediatric population to provide a tool to increase communication of possible surgical urgency. METHODS The SITI scale uses both radiographic and clinical findings, including the GCS score on presentation, pupillary examination, and CT findings. To examine the scale in pediatric TBI, a neurotrauma database at a level 1 pediatric trauma center was retrospectively evaluated, and the SITI score for all patients with an admission diagnosis of TBI between 2010 and 2015 was calculated. The primary endpoint was operative intervention, defined as a craniotomy or craniectomy for decompression, performed within the first 24 hours of admission. RESULTS A total of 1524 patients met inclusion criteria for the study during the 5-year span: 1469 (96.4%) were managed nonoperatively and 55 (3.6%) patients underwent emergent operative intervention. The mean SITI score was 4.98 +/- 0.31 for patients undergoing surgical intervention and 0.41 +/- 0.02 for patients treated nonoperatively (p < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the SITI scale in this pediatric population and was found to be 0.98. Further evaluation of patients presenting with moderate to severe TBI revealed a mean SITI score of 5.51 +/- 0.31 in 40 (15.3%) operative patients and 1.55 +/- 0.02 in 221 (84.7%) nonoperative patients, with an AUROC curve of 0.95. CONCLUSIONS The SITI scale was designed to be a simple, objective communication tool regarding the potential need for surgical decompression after TBI. Application of this scale to a pediatric population reveals that the score correlated with the perceived need for emergent surgical intervention, further suggesting its potential utility in clinical practice.

An Attitude Survey and Assessment of the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Usability of a Traumatic Brain Injury Decision Support Tool in Uganda	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Acceptability; Attitude survey; Decision support; Feasibility; Neurosurgery; Prognostic model; Traumatic brain injury	HEAD-INJURY; IMPACT	BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) prognostic models are potential solutions to severe human and technical shortages. Although numerous TBI prognostic models have been developed, none are widely used in clinical practice, largely because of a lack of feasibility research to inform implementation. We previously developed a prognostic model and Web-based application for in-hospital TBI care in low-resource settings. In this study, we tested the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the application with potential end-users. METHODS: We performed our feasibility assessment with providers involved in TBI care at both a regional and national referral hospital in Uganda. We collected qualitative and quantitative data on decision support needs, application ease of use, and implementation design. RESULTS: We completed 25 questionnaires on potential uses of the app and 11 semistructured feasibility interviews. Top-cited uses were informing the decision to operate, informing the decision to send the patient to intensive care, and counseling patients and relatives. Participants affirmed the potential of the application to support difficult triage situations, particularly in the setting of limited access to diagnostics and interventions, but were hesitant to use this technology with end-of-life decisions. Although all participants were satisfied with the application and agreed that it was easy to use, several expressed a need for this technology to be accessible by smartphone and offline. CONCLUSIONS: We elucidated several potential uses for our app and important contextual factors that will support future implementation.

Validity of S100B protein as a prognostic tool in isolated severe head injuries in emergency patients	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						outcome; S100B protein; traumatic head injuries	BRAIN-DEATH	Introduction Trauma results in 10% of all deaths or five million died annually. In spite of the progress in monitoring and imaging studies, definite, correct prediction of brain death after brain trauma is not possible until now, and brain injury is the third most common cause of mortality in the world. Aim The aim of the study is to identify the validity of S100B protein as a predictor of mortality in isolated severe head trauma patients. Patients and methods Th study was a cross-sectional one that was carried out among 44 patients who presented with isolated severe head trauma to the emergency room. All the patients fulfilled our inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. The initial level of S100B protein was obtained from each patient on admission, 48 h later, and every patient was followed up for 28 days. Results This study demonstrates that the mean of S100B dimer levels within the first 2 h was 0.12 mg/l, while after 48 h the mean was elevated to 1.09 mg/l. In addition, the S100B protein to roll in as a prognostic marker in severe head trauma is 76 and 100%, respectively (sensitivity), while the ability of the test to roll out is 75 and 86% (specificity) and the overall accuracy is 76 and 90%. Conclusion The results of this study confirm the value of quick prognosis for the S100B protein to inform the relatives about the most expected outcome for the patient as this is the most common question asked to the physician and he his answer should have a scientific basis.

J	Harbert, A; Bradford, K; Ritter, V; Northam, WT; Quinsey, C				Harbert, Allie; Bradford, Kathleen; Ritter, Victor; Northam, Weston T.; Quinsey, Carolyn			National Imaging Trends in Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury and Hydrocephalus	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						CT scan; Hydrocephalus; Neuroimaging; Rapid MRI; Traumatic brain injury	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY USE; RADIATION-DOSE REDUCTION; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; HEAD-INJURY; CT SCANS; CHILDREN; SHUNT; EXPOSURE; MRI; CANCER	OBJECTIVE: Reduction in use of computed tomography (CT) in favor of rapid-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to decrease pediatric radiation exposure has varied across institutions in the United States. The aims of this study were to understand national trends in CT and rapid-sequence MRI usage and identify variables affecting imaging practices and obstacles to CT reduction. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of deidentified discharge data for children with hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016. Utilization of MRI without contrast and CT was extracted using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes. Hospital region and age cohorts were extracted and used to categorize data. chi(2) tests and logistic regression were used for analysis. RESULTS: Hospitalizations utilizing CT decreased (P < 0.05) and hospitalizations utilizing MRI increased (P < 0.05) overall in both diagnosis groups throughout the years analyzed. However, there was significant regional variation in imaging. The Northeast had higher CT rates (P < 0.05) and the South had lower CT rates in patients with hydrocephalus and TBI (P < 0.05). No regional variation was found for rates of MRI use in patients with TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide, the average number of discharges after hospitalizations utilizing CT in patients with hydrocephalus and TBI has decreased, while discharges after hospitalizations utilizing MRI as an alternative imaging modality have increased. Despite successful overall CT reduction, significant regional variation exists within this trend showing inconsistent reduction of CT use.

Post-Traumatic Epilepsy after Sports-Related Concussion: A Case Report	NEUROTRAUMA REPORTS			English	Article						brain injury; concussion; post-traumatic epilepsy; sports-related concussion	EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEFINITION	Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are a public health concern across the United States, and they lead to neurological sequelae that can last long after the event itself. Concussive convulsions at the time of injury are common and rarely require additional workup or treatment. Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), however, is a rare phenomenon that can develop after traumatic brain injury and must be managed with adequate medical therapy. Herein we present the case of a 15-year-old football player who developed PTE after an SRC. This condition must be identified through proper education of sports clinicians and those involved in care and management of athletes.

Although launching an effective countermeasure to reduce concussion risk remains challenging for the sports medicine community, we hope to do the following: center dot Health and fitness professionals should use the knowledge and data on concussion prevalence in contact sports presented in the first part of the article to increase awareness of the public at large about the risks of concussions. center dot Explain the biological mechanisms after a head impact and their associated short- and long-term consequences to emphasize the importance of concussion prevention. center dot Inform athletes to minimize head impact events in sports. Even subconcussive head impact events can have serious long-term consequences. Use the information on the physics of impact events to understand the role of neck stiffness. Be on the lookout for concussion avoidance training protocols such as neck stiffness training based on evidence from the physics of collisions, biomechanics, and neuroscience. center dot Encourage athletes, children, and their parents to participate in sports with player safety in mind so children can learn about athleticism, competitiveness, teamwork, and grit without risking traumatic brain injuries.

The purpose of this study was to determine epidemiological and RTS data of a large cohort of high school athletes who sustained 1 or more concussions. Records of 357 consecutive youth patients who sustained concussions and presented to a single health care system between September 2013 and December 2016 were reviewed. Demographic data, RTS, and concussion-related variables were obtained via chart review. Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) scores at baseline and following concussions were performed by neuropsychologists. The average age at injury was 15.5 years (range, 14-18 years), 61.9% of patients were male, 6.7% reported a loss of consciousness, and 14.3% reported amnesia, requiring 30.4 +/- 23.3 days of recovery prior to RTS. The most common sport of injury was football (27.7%). There was a high incidence of previous concussion (33.1%), and 32 athletes sustained a recurrent concussion. A multivariate model demonstrated that females, players with a history of concussion, and those diagnosed in-clinic rather than in-game required increased time to RTS. Memory ImPACT scores were found to increase as players had recurrent concussions. Visual motor speed and reaction time scores decreased with recurrent concussions.

The relationship between hyperoxia and outcomes in patients with TBI remains controversial. We assessed the effect of persistent hyperoxia on the neurological outcomes and survival of critically ill patients with moderate-severe TBI. Method: This was a retrospective cohort study of all adults with moderate-severe TBI admitted to the ICU between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2019 and who required invasive mechanical ventilation. Arterial blood gas data was recorded within the first 3 hours of intubation and then after 6-12 hours and 24-48 hours. The patients were divided into two categories: Group I had a PaO2 < 120mmHg on at least two ABGs undertaken in the first twelve hours post intubation and Group II had a PaO2 >= 120mmHg on at least two ABGs in the same period. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of hospital mortality and good neurologic outcome (Glasgow outcome score >= 4). Results: The study included 309 patients: 54.7% (n=169) in Group I and 45.3% (n=140) in Group II. Hyperoxia was not associated with increased mortality in the ICU (20.1% vs. 17.9%, p=0.62) or hospital (20.7% vs. 17.9%, p=0.53), moreover, the hospital discharge mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale (11.0(5.1) vs. 11.2(4.9), p=0.70) and mean (SD) Glasgow Outcome Score (3.1(1.3) vs. 3.1(1.2), p=0.47) were similar. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, persistent hyperoxia was not associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.34-1.35, p=0.29). PaO2 within the first 3 hours was also not associated with mortality: 121-200mmHg: aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.23-1.49, p=0.26; 201-300mmHg: aOR 0.66, 95% CI 0.27-1.59, p=0.35; 301-400mmHg: aOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.31-2.35, p=0.75 and >400mmHg: aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.18-1.44, p=0.20; reference: PaO2 60-120mmHg within 3 hours. However, hyperoxia >400mmHg was associated with being less likely to have good neurological (GOS >= 4) outcome on hospital discharge (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.98, p=0.046; reference: PaO2 60-120mmHg within 3 hours. Conclusion: In intubated patients with moderate-severe TBI, hyperoxia in the first 48 hours was not independently associated with hospital mortality. However, PaO2 >400mmHg may be associated with a worse neurological outcome on hospital discharge.

Since an AVF is the most common life-threatening cause for pulsatile tinnitus (PT), meticulous evaluation and treatment of patients with PT is crucial. Here, we present two traumatic AVF cases treated with coil embolization leading to no residual fistulous connections followed by an immediate and complete resolution of PT. A 20-year-old man developed left ear tinnitus three months after a traumatic brain injury involving the right temporal bone fracture. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an enlarged left middle meningeal artery (MMA) and a fistular point at the posterior branch of the MMA draining to the middle meningeal vein (MMV) and the left pterygoid plexus, suggesting an AVF. Another 18-year-old girl developed left tinnitus, left exophthalmos, and conjunctival injection 6 months after a traffic accident involving no demonstrable abnormal findings in the radiologic exam. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated a markedly dilated left MMA draining to the MMV, left cavernous sinus, and left superior ophthalmic vein. In both cases, coil embolization was performed with total obliteration of the fistular point.

The mechanisms of these complications remain elusive, and treatment is extremely difficult. Pronounced asymmetric gliosis in hippocampal CA3 fields and dentate gyrus and thinning of pyramidal layer of CA3 (type 3 HS) were observed in rats 6 months after lateral fluid percussion brain injury; symmetrical hippocampal gliosis was observed in sham-operated animals. Decrease in motor activity and signs of anxiety behaviour were observed in both sham and TBI groups and were more likely associated with aging. Behavioral changes were more pronounced in rats after head injury. Late posttraumatic period was characterized by the appearance of long-last- ing epileptiform discharges in cortex and asymmetry of spikes in hippocampus. In two rats in the late posttraumatic period epileptic seizures were found. Accelerated brain aging in rats with traumatic brain injury as well as neurodegenerative changes in hippocampus may be associated with chronic distant neuroinflammation in hippocampus. These mechanisms possibly play important role in the development of post-traumatic epilepsy and dementia.	[Komoltsev, I. G.; Volkova, A. A.; Levshina, I. P.; Novikova, M.

The identification of these needs is a key factor in providing high-quality nursing care. In this regard, nurse, as one of the main members of the healthcare team who is in a frequent and close contact with these children, has a good opportunity to identify and meet their care needs. This study aimed to explain the experiences of nurses with the care needs of the children under 18 years with head trauma hospitalized in the intensive care units. Methods: The present study was conducted using qualitative content analysis method and through in-depth semi- structured individual interviews with 14 nurses working in the ICUs from August 2019 to January 2020. Purposive sampling method was used and the data were collected using an audio recorder until data saturation was reached. These data were analyzed through the use of conventional qualitative content analysis. Results: Finally, two main categories of "supportive care needs" and "care needs for the prevention of secondary complications" were extracted. The former main categories included two sub-categories of "physical support" and "psychological support" and the latter included two sub-categories of "cares for the prevention of intracranial secondary complications" and "cares for the prevention of extracranial secondary complications". Conclusion: Based on the results, children with head trauma have different care needs in different dimensions. Therefore, the healthcare team should have a need-based care plan to meet these needs and improve the health and well-being of this group of patients.

This study seeks to describe a novel clinical research modality to establish best practices for enrolling a diverse pediatric TBI population and quantifying key information on enrollment into biobanks. Screening form responses were standardized and cleaned through Google Sheets. Data were used to analyze total individuals at each enrollment stage. R was utilized for final analysis, including logistic model and proportion statistical tests, to determine further significance and relationships. Issues throughout data cleaning shed light on limitations of the consent modality. The results suggest that through a diverse research team, the recruited sample exceeds traditional measures of representation (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity). Sex demographics of the study are representative of the local population. Screening for candidates is critical to the success of the consent modality. The consent modality may be modified to increase the diversity of the study population and accept bilingual candidates.

Concussion Knowledge and Clinical Experience Among Athletic Trainers: Implications for Concussion Health Care Practices	JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING			English	Article						mild traumatic brain injury; clinical practice; sports medicine	ASSOCIATION POSITION STATEMENT; MANAGEMENT; SPORT; BEHAVIORS; ATTITUDES; SERVICES	Context: Athletic trainers (ATs) are heavily involved in concussion assessment and return-to-play (RTP) decision making. Despite ATs' crucial role, few researchers have directly examined ATs' knowledge of concussions or whether concussion knowledge or clinical experience affects clinical concussion-management practices. Objective: To determine the overall concussion knowledge of ATs and whether concussion knowledge and clinical experience affect concussion-assessment and -management practices. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Online survey. Patients or Other Participants: Random convenience sample of 8725 (15.0% response rate [1307/8725]; certified, 14.8 +/- 10.6 years) ATs surveyed from the National Athletic Trainers' Association membership. Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey collected demographics, concussion-assessment and -management tools used, and concussion knowledge (patient-clinician scenarios, signs and symptoms recognition). We used multiple logistic regression models to determine the odds ratios (ORs) for using assessment and management tools based on signs and symptoms recognition and years of clinical experience. Results: The ATs correctly identified 78.0% +/- 15.1% of concussion signs and symptoms. Approximately 46% (357/770) of ATs indicated an athlete could RTP if the athlete stated he or she had a "bell rung." Every additional year of clinical experience decreased the odds of using standardized sideline-assessment tools by 3% (OR = 0.97, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.95, 0.99). The odds of using standardized sideline tools (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96, 0.99) and symptom checklists (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97, 0.99) for RTP assessment were significantly decreased for each additional year of clinical experience. No other tools used for RTP assessment were influenced by signs and symptoms recognition (P > .136) or clinical experience (P > .158). Conclusions: The ATs with greater clinical experience had lower odds of using concussion-assessment and -management tools. Athletic trainers should frequently review and implement current consensus guidelines into clinical practice to improve concussion recognition and prevent improper management.

Surgical management of these lesions presents a challenge as they are in close proximity to the sagittal sinus and bridging veins. IHSDHs are poorly characterized clinically and their exact incidence is unknown. There are also no clear guidelines for the management of IHSDH. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all admitted patients with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury over a 4-year period at a Level I trauma centre. Clinical characteristics of all patients with subdural hematoma (SDH) and IHSDH were collected. Results: Of 2165 admissions, 1182 patients had acute traumatic SDHs, 420 patients had IHSDHs (1.9% of admissions and 35.5% of SDH), 35 (8.3% of IHSDH) were >= 8 mm in width. IHSDH was isolated in 16 (3.8%) of the cases. Average age was 61.7 +/- 21.5 years for all IHSDHs and 77.1 +/- 10.4 for large IHSDH (p < 0.001). For large IHSDH, a transient loss of consciousness (LOC) occurred in 51.5% of individuals, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) in 47.8% of cases, and motor weakness in 37.9% of patients. Five of the large IHSDH patients presented with motor deficits directly related to the IHSDH, and weakness resolved in four of these five individuals. None were treated surgically. Progression of IHSDH width occurred in one patient. Conclusion: IHSDHs are often referred to as rare entities. Our results show they are common. Conservative management is appropriate to manage most IHSDHs, as most resolve spontaneously, and their symptoms resolve as well.

A magnetic resonance study of normal and arthritic shoulders	ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND			English	Article						Shoulder, anatomy; Axillary nerve; Magnetic resonance imaging; MRI	ARTHROPLASTY; INJURY	INTRODUCTION Axillary nerve injury is a major complication of shoulder surgery during glenoid exposure. The aim of this study was to measure the mean distance between the inferior glenoid and the axillary nerve in healthy shoulders and then to compare this distance between osteoarthritic and rotator cuff deficient glenohumeral joints. METHODS The magnetic resonance images of 50 patients with normal glenohumeral joints were reviewed. The infra-glenoid tubercle was determined as a fixed point and the distance to the axillary nerve was measured. Two separate assessors measured on the same sagittal sections. With a study power of 80%, the sample needed in each comparison group was 28 patients. Measurements were then performed on scans in patients with osteoarthritis and cuff tear arthropathy. The mean distance was compared between groups. RESULTS The mean distance between the infra-glenoid tubercle and axillary nerve was 12mm (standard deviation, SD, 5.6mm) in normal shoulders, 10.6mm (SD 5.4mm) in shoulders with osteoarthritis and 9.7mm (SD 3.7mm) in those with cuff tear arthropathy. For this sample size of 50 patients with a confidence interval of 95%, the mean range is 12mm (95% CI 10.4-13.6). A comparison between normal shoulder and osteoarthritis showed a p-value of 0.3, and between normal and cuff tear arthropathy a p-value of 0.06. This was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The axillary nerve lies on average 12mm from the infra-glenoid tubercle. The presence of inferior osteophytes in glenohumeral osteoarthritis and the proximal migration of humeral head in cuff tear arthropathy does not seem to alter the course of the nerve significantly in relation to the inferior glenoid tubercle.

J	Merchan, EJH; Betancur, DCC				Merchan, Edna Johanna Herrera; Betancur, Dora Cristina Canas			Post-Traumatic Stress as a Precursor of Mental Health Damage and Cognitive Impairment in Victims of Violence	DIVERSITAS-PERSPECTIVAS EN PSICOLOGIA			Spanish	Article						violence; post-traumatic stress disorder; brain damage; mental health	WORKING-MEMORY; DISORDER; TRAUMA; ATTENTION; VOLUME; SLEEP; WOMEN	This article aims to demonstrate how violence is a socially damaging act that generates mental health detriment and cognitive impairment. A systematic review of articles was carried out based on the PRISMA guidelines. Studies found were related to psychopathology, violence, and cognitive impairment in victims of violence. A total of 50 articles, dated from 2008 to 2018, were systematized in databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsicoDoc, Proquest, and Google Scholar. The keywords were health*violence, psychopathology*violence, cognitive impairment*violence, mental health*violence, cognitive impairment*violence, war*mental health, traumatic stress*brain injury. The results indicate that the most frequent mental health damage derived from violent acts is the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that causes cognitive impairment in attention, working memory, and learning, which are necessary cognitive functions for optimal performance in daily life. Besides, PTSD triggers disorders such as depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric diseases such as bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia.

J	Mishra, A; Pandey, P; Mishra, SC				Mishra, Anupam; Pandey, Pankaj; Mishra, Subhash Chandra			Olfaction in Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma: The first study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						Nasopharynx; Angiofibroma; Olfaction	PRESERVATION; SURGERY; ANOSMIA; SMELL	Background: To study the pattern of olfactory dysfunction/recovery in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). Methods: Olfactory assessment was undertaken in 30 patients (categoryl) both pre- & post-operatively and in another 18 (category 2) only postoperative. All patients underwent transpalatal excision and variables of interest included age, radiological stage/parameters & tumor size. Results: Objective olfactory dysfunction was seen in 60% while involvement of olfactory strip was suggested in 50%. Despite some marginal trends only noted between size/age with change of olfaction, Pearson's correlation WA did not reveal any significance amongst multiple variables. However a better recovery of olfaction following surgery was evident in Category-2 where Chi-Square WA (p < 0.05) significantly revealed this to be a function of postoperative duration. This regenerative course in JNA suggests an optimum period of 4 years for full recovery after surgery. Conclusion: In this first study of olfaction in JNA many new trends have been appreciated. In general, deteriorations of olfaction were seen due to 'vascular-concussion' effect in early postoperative phase where postsurgical clearance of airway showed minimal effect in terms of improvement. The hypervascularity of olfactory epithelium with possible hormonal effects may be responsible for the unique pattern of olfactory function and recovery in JNA.

Objective: Present study had focused on the prevalence of gunshot wounds, alsoclinical consequenccsdcpending on differences in anatomical sites, age, gender with management strategies accordingly. Materials and Methods: The study design is retrospective in nature with quantitative approach and the study reviewed the data in the registers beginning from January to December 2017. Demographic data of the patients, anatomical sites of injuries, and findings of clinical outcomes had been retrospectively evaluated. Results: 1145 patients having gunshot wounds (GSW)had been included in the study (M/F= 1067 (93%)/78 (7%)). Average incidence of head injuries had been found as 8,75% which had showed a peak rate during May with a percentage of 11%. Thoracic injuries which had an average incidence of 11,3% had the highest rates during May, January, February and June. Abdominal injuries had showed a steady decline beginning from January (24%) till June (20%) with having least percentage of injury during May (13%).Only 10% of healthcare workers were among educated first aiders who transported the patients. Meanwhile,the majority had consisted of non-educatedones who took the patients to the hospital at the largest proportion of the casualties which include families, friends and close relatives. Mortalities (n=87 (8%)) were attributed mostlyto abdominaln=18 (21%), thoracic n=16 (18%), lower limbn=16 (18%)) and head n=14 (16%) injuries withdecreasing frequency. Conclusions: Deaths due to gunshot wounds (GSW) had been reported highestamong young aged population who are between 21 and 40 years of age. Considering that only 10% of rescue teams were among educated health care givers, this actual rate of mortality given in the present study can be lowered much more if the state can provide more educated staff, and also more fundamental first-care educations could be given for the public as well.

Fixed Positioning for Decompressive Hemicraniectomy Provides a Larger Diameter Flap than Nonfixed Positioning: A Single-Institution Experience	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Hemicraniectomy; Neurotrauma; Operative technique	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; BONE FLAP; CRANIECTOMY; SIZE; COMPLICATIONS; HERNIATION; INFARCTION; AREA	BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) is well established as an effective life-saving intervention. Although literature documents a correlation between mortality and hemicraniectomy flap size, no literature exists demonstrating whether a larger flap may be achieved with 3-pin fixation devices versus nonfixed positioning (e.g., occipital headrest, gel donut). Therefore, positioning for DHC remains the preference of the institution and attending physician. METHODS: Patients undergoing DHC during 2005-2016 were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Inclusion criteria were: operative note available in the electronic medical record and postoperative head computed tomography (hCT). Exclusion criteria were: age <18 years, missing data in electronic medical record, no postoperative hCT performed, and craniectomy not done with intention of performing a hemicraniectomy (i.e., craniotomy converted to craniectomy). Anteroposterior diameter of the hemicraniectomy flap was measured in millimeters on the postoperative hCT. The average diameter was compared between the fixed positioning and nonfixed positioning groups. RESULTS: Analysis included 522 patients who met inclusion criteria; 363 were in the fixed positioning group, and 159 were in the nonfixed positioning group. The average hemicraniectomy diameter was 132.17 mm in the fixed positioning group, and 129.74 mm in the nonfixed positioning group, which was statistically significant (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale single-institution study evaluating whether operative positioning for DHC affects the size of a hemicraniectomy flap. Positioning in 3-point fixation led to a statistically significant larger average diameter compared with nonfixed positioning. This indicates that the risks associated with pin fixation as well as additional time spent in positioning in this fashion are offset by the ability to obtain a larger hemicraniectomy flap, which is associated with decreased mortality.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Annual Meeting of the Pediatric-Trauma-Society (PTS)	NOV 13-16, 2019	San Diego, CA	Pediat Trauma Soc		PECARN; Blunt head trauma; CT head; Pediatric trauma; Pediatric surgery	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; HEAD-INJURY	Background: The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) criteria identify children at low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) in whom CT head (CTH) is unnecessary. We assessed compliance with PECARN at outside hospitals (OSH) among children transferred to our pediatric trauma center. Methods: Patients <18 years transferred between May 2016 and December 2018 undergoing CTH at an OSH were reviewed. A ciTBI was defined as one requiring hospitalization >= 2 midnights, intubation >24 h, neurosurgical intervention, or causing death. Results: 202 children were transferred after CTH. 53 were excluded for incomplete records (16), suspected abuse (33), or penetrating injury (4). Of the 149 included children, PECARN recommended CTH in 39 (26.2%), shared decision making in 79 (53.0%), and no imaging in 31 (20.8%). 26 children (17.4%) had a radiographic traumatic brain injury (rTBI) while only 6 (4.0%) had ciTBIs. Of those with ciTBIs, PECARN recommended CTH in 4 and shared decision making in 2. No child in whom CTH was not recommended had a ciTBI. 45 (30.2%) children had isolated extracranial injuries requiring transfer and 83 (55.7%) were transferred despite normal CTHs and no associated injuries. 2 (1.3%) children underwent non-emergent surgery for ciTBI. Conclusions: Compliance with PECARN was low among referring facilities with nearly 75% of CTHs being potentially avoidable with proper adherence and parental counseling. Deferring imaging until after transfer appears safe as no child underwent emergent intervention upon arrival. Early transfer and improved compliance with PECARN may reduce the number of CTHs performed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Pennell, Christopher; Arthur, L.

Aim of this interventional study is to verify if neurobiological Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC) treatments Neuro Postural Optimization (NPO) and Tissue Optimization (TO) are able respectively to improve neuro psychomotor strategies and facilitate recovery process in medial collateral ligaments (MCL) lesions of the knee. Patients and methods: 45 healthy subjects, 32 males and 13 females, with knee MCL lesion, diagnosed with MRI or ultrasound. Within 4 days after the trauma, subjects were clinically evaluated (T0), both through medical and subjective assessments. Clinical evaluation was repeated after the REAC NPO treatment (T1) and at the end of 18 REAC TO treatments (T2) and at the 30 days follow-up (T3). Results: In comparison with the results commonly found in clinical practice, all REAC treated patients recovered much faster. They reported functional recovery, pain relief and joint stability, regardless of the severity of the lesion. Conclusion: The combined use of REAC NPO and TO can envisage a new rehabilitative approach, which aims not only at recovering the outcomes of the physical trauma, but also at improving the neuropsychical state that can condition the rehabilitation result.

Different Perceptions Exist Between Health Care Providers and the General Population Regarding the Importance of Findings on Additional Imaging for Trauma Consults	AMERICAN SURGEON			English	Article						patient centered care; trauma imaging; injury significance	SHARED DECISION-MAKING	Background Approximately one-third of additional imaging for trauma consults results in the discovery of new injuries. No studies have addressed the perception of these findings in non-health care providers. Our hypothesis was that significant differences in perception of the importance of injuries would exist between health care providers (HCPs) and the general population. Methods Six standardized scenarios were developed detailing common new injury findings on additional imaging in trauma consults. Demographics as well as information regarding the significance of findings, potential for change in care, and the importance of patient notification were collected. Surveys were electronically distributed to HCPs in our system and the public. Data analysis was performed with generalized linear modeling. Results A total of 339 public and 129 HCP surveys were returned. HCPs included attending staff, residents, and advanced care providers from a variety of specialties. Significant differences in perception were found in traumatic brain injury, spine fractures, and rib fractures, with HCPs rating most findings as less clinically important than the general population, while rating patient notification as more important. Perceived importance decreased with increased age in the general population. Increasing HCP age or length in practice did not significantly affect perception of clinical importance, except for rib fractures. Discussion Differences in perception exist regarding the significance of additional injuries between HCPs and the general population. Perceptions of the general population also change with age. Decisions to pursue additional imaging in trauma patients should include consideration of these differences in perception to help support quality patient-centered care.

Establishing the Factor Structure of a Health-Related Quality of Life Measurement System for Caregivers of Persons Living With Traumatic Brain Injury	ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Brain injuries; Caregivers; Quality of life; Patient reported outcome measures; Rehabilitation; Veterans	ITEM BANKS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; OUTCOME MEASURES; SOCIAL HEALTH; FAMILY; REHABILITATION; INDIVIDUALS; SUPERVISION; CALIBRATION; PROGRAM	Objectives: To understand the factor structure of health-related quality of life specific to caregivers of people living with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Prospective, cross-sectional data collection. Setting: Three TBI Model Systems rehabilitation hospitals, an academic medical center, and a military medical treatment facility. Participants: Caregivers (N=558) of people who have sustained a TBI (344 caregivers of civilians and 214 caregivers of service members or veterans; 85% women; 58% spouses; mean age, 46.12 +/- 14.07y) who have provided care for an average of 5.82 +/- 5.40 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcomes Measures: The Traumatic Brain Injury Caregiver Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) measurement system including 10 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item banks (anger, anxiety, depression, social isolation, sleep disturbance, fatigue, ability to participate in social roles and activities, satisfaction with social roles and activities, emotional support, informational support) and 5 TBI-CareQOL banks (feelings of loss-self, feelings of loss-person with TBI, feeling trapped, caregiver-specific anxiety, caregiver strain). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis model fit indices were compared for 14 empirically derived and 5 theoretically derived models. Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that the best model fit was for a 6-factor model with dimensions that included mental health, social support, social participation, social isolation, physical health, and caregiver emotion. Conclusions: Results indicated that a 6-factor model provided the best model fit for health-related quality of life in caregivers of individuals with TBI. These results have utility for both research and clinical applications. Establishing the TBI-CareQOL's factor structure provides preliminary evidence of the measurement system's construct validity, helps inform the selection of measures for specific research or clinical interventions, and informs the development of composite scores.

Setting: Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems centers. Participants: Persons with moderate to severe TBI (N= 5054) enrolled in the TBI Model Systems National Database with complete outcome data for the outcomes of interest at 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up. Design: Secondary analysis of a prospective longitudinal data set. Main Measures: Prior and intercurrent TBI from the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Results: Priormoderate-severeTBIs significantly predicted overall level of functioning on the DRS, FIM Cognitive, and FIM Motor for participants with less severe index injuries. Moderate-severe intercurrent TBIs (TBIs subsequent to the index injury) were predictive of poorer functioning for both Index Severity groups, reflected in higher mean scores on the DRS in participants with less severe index injuries and lower mean Cognitive FIM in participants with more severe index injuries. Conclusion: Multiple brain injuries, particularly those of moderate or greater severity, have a significantly greater impact on patients' level of functioning compared with a single injury, but not the rate or shape of recovery.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate Silymarine effects on prognosis of patients with severe and moderate traumatic brain injury. Study Design . This double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting . Valiasr hospital hospital in Arak, Iran. Subjects and Methods . Research was performed among patients between 15 and 65 years of age with severe moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale score 9 to 12) and moderate (GCS 3 to 8) traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients were divided into two groups (Each group: 40 patients). Patients assigned to the control groupwere receiving all standard treatments. Patients in case groups were administered 140 mg of silymarin every 8 hours for 7 days. We Checked the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), GCS, age, gender, location, mechanism of trauma, site of accident and the incidence time of accident to arrival at emergency unite. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (SPSS version 18; Chicago, IL). Results . Our findings suggested that there was no a significant difference between intervention group and control in terms of parameters as GOS, GCS, age, gender, location, mechanism of trauma, and site of accident and the incidence time of accident to arrival at emergency unite (P> .05). Brain CT in two groups showed a significant difference (P = .002), where in the silymarin group there were more normal cases when comparing with control group. Conclusions . Silymarin did not reveal a significant effect for improving prognosis of patients with moderate and severe TBI.

Identification of adverse events in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury patients to target evidence-based prevention for increased performance improvement and patient safety	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Pediatrics; Critical care; Intensive care units; Pediatric; Brain injuries; Traumatic; Iatrogenic disease; Evidence-based practice; Quality improvement; Patient safety	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; IATROGENIC ILLNESS; PRESSURE ULCERS; PREVALENCE; RISK; INTERVENTIONS; COMPLICATIONS; ERRORS	Introduction: Trauma centres are required to continuously measure, evaluate and improve care. Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients are highly susceptible to adverse events (AE; unintended, potentially harmful events resulting from health care) due to their unstable condition requiring high risk interventions, multiple medications and invasive monitoring. Objectives were to describe: (1) a process for identifying AE in pediatric sTBI patients to identify safety risks, target and implement evidence-based prevention strategies; and (2) a tertiary care PICU's sTBI AE experience. Methods: Merging databases, Trauma Registry with Adverse Events Management System, identified AE in patients. Details on the event location, type and severity of harm were combined with patient demographics, injury data, costs and outcomes in a cohort of 193 PICU sTBI patients (2000-15). Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were undertaken to describe AE, and their association with risk factors and outcomes. Results: 103/193 sTBI patients (53%) suffered at least one AE. 238 AE occurred (1.23 AE/patient), with 30% of patients having 2+ AE. Most resulted in no harm (54%) with decubitus ulcers (15%) the most common AE. AE patients were more likely to be monitored for elevated ICP (p<0.001), with fewer ventilator-free days (p=0.015), longer LOS for PICU (11 vs. 3.5 days; p<0.001) and in-hospital (31 vs. 11 days; p<0.001) with higher median costs ($121,234 vs. $53,341; p=0.031). AE patients required a higher level of care on discharge (p=0.035). Conclusions: Merging databases is an effective practice to identify AE and safety risks in trauma populations. Utilizing this method, a PICU AE rate of 1.23 events per patient was found with TBI severity the most important factor to increase the odds of AE. AE represent performance improvement events, opportunities to optimize care, decrease costs, as well as improve outcomes, to ultimately improve patient safety in this vulnerable population.

J	Tolland, J; Miccile, LA; Burke, K				Tolland, Joseph; Miccile, Lauren A.; Burke, Katherine			Effect of Physical Therapy Dosage on Functional Recovery Following TBI	JOURNAL OF ACUTE CARE PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SUPPORTED TREADMILL; BODY-WEIGHT; DOSE-RESPONSE; STROKE; REHABILITATION; OUTCOMES; PEOPLE; DISCHARGE; LOCOMOTOR	Background/Purpose: Evidence supporting neurorehabilitation dosage after traumatic brain injury is limited. High-dose, high-intensity intervention, involving maximal frequency, time, and patient participation, facilitates neuroplasticity and optimizes outcomes. This patient made significant functional progress with the dosage of therapy provided, warranting investigation into the optimal dosage of therapy in this patient population. Case Description: A 27-year-old man with severe, traumatic brain injury defined by the Glasgow Coma Scale received physical therapy in an acute care hospital within a large academic medical center. Due to insurance complications, he was unable to be discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. He remained in the hospital receiving physical therapy until he was safe to be discharged home. Intervention: The patient received an average of 16 minutes of physical therapy, 4 times/week, totaling 320 minutes over 35 additional days spent in the acute hospital setting. Treatment focused on progressing functional mobility, preventing complications, and task-specific functional training. Outcomes: The patient received a 79% lower dosage of physical therapy than expected based on standard requirements at an acute rehabilitation facility. The patient progressed from actively performing less than 25% of functional tasks to performing 100% of functional tasks with supervision for safety. He ambulated with supervision and negotiated stairs with contact guard assistance at time of discharge. Discussion: The patient made significant functional gains. This raises the question of optimal dosage of rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury. We challenge therapists to consider that the optimal dose of rehabilitation in the acute care setting remains unknown and further investigation is needed.

Pedestrian hit by a car impacted metal pole: reconstructing the head load	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Pedestrian accident; Head injury; Bending traffic sign pole; Trauma biomechanics	INJURY; COLLISION; MODEL	Fatal head injuries are frequently seen in pedestrians hit by motorized vehicles. In our case, the pedestrian sustained a devastating head injury with skull splitting in the mediosagittal plane. A car collided with a traffic sign causing a bending of the pole. The metal pole hit a man standing close beside it; the man had a head injury severity that is more commonly due to falling objects than due to traffic accidents. Assuming a head mass of 5 kg, simplified calculations yield maximum contact forces of ca. 36 kN exceeding mean parietal fracture forces which are in the order of magnitude of 12.5 kN. The influences of the effective body mass and the horizontal distance between the pole and the pedestrian on maximum contact forces are investigated. High contact forces in our case can be mainly explained by the comparably high impact velocity and by a partial mass transfer of the total car mass to the pole.

J	Wannasewok, K				Wannasewok, Kamonnet			A role for cognitive remediation therapy for job seekers with neuropsychiatric disorders	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION COUNSELLING			English	Article						Cognitive remediation; neuropsychiatric disorders; mental illness; employment		People with mental illness and traumatic brain injury experience difficulties in gaining and maintaining employment and have a higher unemployment rate because of their symptoms and poor social skills including cognitive impairments. Cognitive remediation is an intervention developed to improve cognitive functioning such as attention, memory, and problem-solving, by providing them with specific designed cognitive exercises. After practicing those cognitive tasks repetitively and massively, people with cognitive deficits will improve cognitive processes which lead to better cognitive performance. There is evidence supporting the benefits of cognitive remediation in improving employment-related outcome.

Chance			Analysis of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Outpatient Follow-Up	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA NURSING			English	Article						Concussion clinic; Mild traumatic brain injury; Trauma nurse practitioner	CONCUSSION EVALUATION	Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains a prevalent public health concern. Implementation of an mTBI guideline encouraged screening all patients at risk for mTBI, followed by outpatient follow-up in a "concussion clinic." This resulted in an increase in inpatient concussion evaluations, followed by high-volume referral to the concussion clinic. This prompted the routine use of an outpatient mTBI symptom screening tool. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to analyze the characteristics of an mTBI population at outpatient follow-up and describe the clinicians' care recommendations as determined through the use of an mTBI symptom screening tool. Methods: This is a retrospective review of mTBI patients at a Level 1 trauma center. The study includes patients who completed a concussion screening in the outpatient setting over a 6-month period. Patients were included if older than 16 years, sustained blunt trauma, and had a formal neurocognitive evaluation by a certified speech therapist within 48 hr of initial injury. Results: Of the 247 patients included, 197 (79.8%) were referred to the concussion clinic, 33 (13.4%) had no further outpatient needs, and 17 (6.9%) were referred for outpatient neurocognitive rehabilitation. On follow-up, 97 patients were deemed to have no further postconcussion needs by the trauma nurse practitioner; 57 patients were cleared by the speech therapist. In total, 43 outpatient mTBI follow-up encounters resulted in referral for ongoing therapy. Conclusion: Routine screening for concussion symptoms and detailed clinical evaluation allows for prompt recognition of further posttraumatic mTBI needs.

Narratives exploit this mechanism to create an emotional bond with the characters and to maintain the engagement of the audience throughout the story. In this paper, we illustrate a case study in emotion understanding in stories that exploits a computational agent to explore emotion impairment in a group of traumatic brain injured people. The study focuses on moral emotions, aiming to investigate the differences in moral functioning that characterize traumatic brain injured patients. After comparing the understanding of the moral and emotional facets of the agent's behavior in traumatic brain injured patients and in neurologically intact controls, slight-yet meaningful-differences were observed between the two groups. We describe the test methodology and results, highlighting their implications for the design of rehabilitation applications based on virtual agents.

However, few studies have examined patient-reported auditory symptomatology and quality-of-life metrics in individuals with TBI. We hypothesize that following TBI, individuals can experience auditory symptoms even with hearing thresholds in the normal range. Adult patients with normal auditory thresholds and a history of TBI were evaluated for subjective hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, hyperacusis, and autophony. Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, and Hyperacusis Questionnaire were administered. Thirty-one patients were prospectively recruited. Twenty-eight TBI participants (90%) reported >= 1 auditory symptoms at the time of survey intake. Mild to severe handicap in the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory was reported in 71.4% and 40% of the participants with hearing loss and tinnitus, respectively. Hyperacusis handicap was considered significant in 41.1% of the participants who complained of hyperacusis and completed the survey. Despite normal hearing thresholds, individuals with TBI experience decrements in auditory quality-of-life metrics. Level of evidence: 3.

We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the effect of diaphragm thickness on rehabilitation outcomes of post-ICU patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to evaluate factors that may be associated with diaphragm atrophy. Materials and methods Fifty-one patients (26 SCI, 25 TBI) who admitted to the rehabilitation clinic from the ICU included in this study. All demographic data were recorded. All participants underwent diaphragmatic ultrasonography evaluation before and after 12 weeks of neurologic rehabilitation program. The diaphragm thickness and outcome parameters were compared in all patient groups and in each patient subgroups. Evaluation parameters of patients before and after treatment were compared in patient subgroups. Results Diaphragm atrophy was found in 14 patients (64%) in TBI group and 12 patients (46%) in SCI group. The diaphragm thickness negatively correlated with the ICU length of stay and positively correlated with the before/after rehabilitation functional scores and the change in functional independence measure scores (p < 0.05). According to the regression analysis; the change in functional independence measure scores was found to be affected by the diaphragm thickness (p < 0.05). Conclusions The diaphragm thickness may be an effective factor on the rehabilitation process.

The cross-sectional study is based on data from the "Danish register for young adults with acquired brain injury" on TBI survivors included from October 2013 to December 2016. The main measures were Major depression inventory, Trail making test A and B, Fluency, Word learning with selective reminding, Matrix reasoning, Coding and Glasgow outcome scale - extended (GOS-E). During the study period, 131 young TBI survivors were referred to one of five national outpatient clinics. Ninety-six had complete data and of these 14.6% fulfilled the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for depression and 34.4% had cognitive sequelae. An association was found between depression and cognitive sequelae (p = 0.004). Patients with both depression and cognitive sequelae (n = 10) had a significantly lower mean score on GOS-E (p = 0.0001). Depression and cognitive sequelae were frequent and associated with a poorer global functional outcome among young TBI survivors referred within a year after trauma. This finding and the notion that only 20% of the expected TBI population was referred to this nationwide health initiative indicate an unacknowledged need for interdisciplinary follow-up.

Several actors may facilitate or act as a barrier to a successful return to work (RTW). This qualitative study used semi-structured in-depth interviews with 22 adults with mTBI at 2-5 years post injury, targeting experiences of how different actors facilitated or acted as a barrier in the RTW process, and encompassed the mTBI trajectory from the acute phase to the post-acute phase. A thematic analysis with a hermeneutical phenomenological approach was used to analyse data. Three main themes emerged. (1) Worker-employer relationship: Workplace accommodations such as decreased working hours, modified working conditions, and support from co-workers were lacking. (2) The role of the general practitioner: The general practitioner was lacking treatment and referral opportunities and failed to provide the patient with relevant and individualized guidance. (3) Municipal case management: Participants perceived being met with distrust by social workers, follow-up assessments were too frequent, unnecessary, and did not target concussion, and rehabilitation was referred too late. Clinical practice guidelines to improve referral to relevant concussion rehabilitation in case of persistent symptoms are needed to inform clinicians, employers, and public institutions to facilitate a successful RTW.

We sought to better understand the impact of these interventions on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral hemodynamics. We conducted a prospective study in TBI patients requiring ICP monitoring. The timing of position changes and suctioning episodes were recorded with concurrent blood pressure and ICP measurements. We collected data on 460 patient position changes and 204 suctioning episodes over 2404 h in 18 ventilated patients (mean age 34 [13] years, median Glasgow Coma Score 4 [3-7]). We recorded 24 (20-31) positioning and 11 (6-18) suctioning episodes per patient, with 54% and 39% of position changes associated with ICP >= 22 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) <60 mm Hg, respectively, and 22% and 27% of suctioning episodes associated with an ICP >= 22 mm Hg and CPP <60 mm Hg. The median change in ICP was 11 (6-16) mm Hg after position changes and 3 (1-9) mm Hg after suctioning. Reduction in CPP to <60 mm Hg lasted >= 10 min in 17% of positioning and 11% of suctioning episodes. The baseline ICP and its amplitude were both predictive of a rise in ICP >= 22 mm Hg after positioning and suctioning episodes, whereas cerebral autoregulation was not. Baseline CPP was predictive of a decrease in CPP <60 mm Hg after both interventions. Increases in ICP and reductions in CPP are common following patient positioning and tracheal suctioning episodes. Frequently, these changes are substantial and sustained.

Background The length of hospitalisation following TBI is constantly decreasing, and patients may return home with several problems. FMs care for the patients at home although they may not be prepared for the patient's medical needs or financial burden of the illness. The burden which some FMs experience can impair patient care and rehabilitation outcomes. Therefore, FMs require support during acute phases of TBI treatment. Design A structured questionnaire was sent to 216 TBI patients FMs. The response rate was 47% (n = 102). Methods A structured questionnaire-based on a systematic literature review and a previous questionnaire on TBI patient FMs' perceptions of support-was developed and used in the data collection. The questionnaire included 46 statements and 11 background questions. Data were collected via an electronic questionnaire. The STROBE checklist was followed in reporting the study. Results A factor analysis identified five factors that describe the guidance of TBI patient FMs: guidance of TBI patients' symptoms and survival; benefits of guidance; needs-based guidance; guidance for use of services; and guidance methods. Most of the FMs (51%-88%) felt that they had not received enough guidance from healthcare professionals in acute care hospitals across all five aspects of support. Conclusions The content of guidance should be developed, and healthcare staff should be trained to consider a FM's starting point when providing guidance. A calm environment, proper timing, sufficient information in different forms and professional healthcare staff were found to be key factors to comprehensive guidance. Involving FMs in the discharge process and rehabilitation of their loved ones both supports the abilities of caregivers and promotes the outcome of the patient's rehabilitation. Relevance to clinical practice This study provides varied information on the need for social support of TBI patients FMs in the early stages of treatment from the FMs' perspective. This research adopted the FM's perspective to identify various areas of social support that need to be developed so that the FMs of TBI patients receive enough support during the early stages of TBI treatment.

Methods The cohort of this prospective clinical study included 30 healthy subjects (mean age 25 +/- 2 years) and 30 TBI patients (43 +/- 22 years) comprising 11 patients with moderate TBI and 19 patients with mild TBI. The healthy subjects were examined once, whereas the TBI patients were examined immediately after hospitalization, at 1 week, and at 2 months. A virtual reality (VR) program displayed three-dimensional rendering of four rotating soccer balls over VR glasses in different gaze directions. The subjects were instructed to select the ball that appeared to be raised from the screen as quickly as possible via remote control. The response times and fusion abilities in different gaze directions were recorded. Results The correlation between stereopsis and TBI severity was significant. The response times of the moderate and mild TBI groups were significantly longer than those of the healthy reference group. The response times of the moderate TBI group were significantly longer than those of the mild TBI group. The response times at follow-up examinations were significantly shorter than those immediately after hospitalization. Fusion ability was primarily defective in the gaze direction to the right (90 degrees) and left (270 degrees and 315 degrees). Conclusions TBI patients showed impaired stereopsis. Measuring stereopsis in different positions of the visual field using VR can be effective for rapid concussion assessment.

Method An online survey was conducted with 68 speech pathologists who worked with TBI across metropolitan and rural settings in Australia. The survey investigated the reasons speech pathologists work with friends, barriers to working with friends and perceptions of successful friendships post TBI. Descriptive statistics and content analysis of open ended responses were used to analyze the data. Results There were more speech pathologists (40%) who did not include friends compared to those who did. Friends were most commonly included in the rehabilitation process, through the provision of education programs. The primary rationale for working with friends was to prevent negative psychosocial outcomes for the person with TBI. There were numerous barriers to working with friends, most commonly the inability to access friends. Conclusions Making and keeping friends are a significant part of most people's lives. Therefore, it is important to consider their role in contributing to improved outcomes for people with TBI. With communication partner training being an integral component to recovery and maintenance of relationships post TBI, the development of targeted education and training materials is warranted, to enable the inclusion of friends in the rehabilitation process.

Much of the relevant literature is focused on the initial management and proper reduction techniques, although the prevalence of associated injuries can reach 80%. A case of LEH associated with greater tuberosity (GT) fracture and rotator cuff (RC) tear in a young laborer managed with closed reduction and arthroscopic repair of the labrum and rotator cuff is presented. Case Report: A 28-year-old man presented to our hospital with severe pain in his right shoulder after a high-impact motor vehicle accident. Standard anteroposterior radiographs revealed an inferior dislocation (LEH) of the right shoulder and a fracture of the GT. The patient was initially managed with closed reduction under mild intravenous sedation, using a 2-step maneuver followed by arthroscopic evaluation of the joint the next day. During arthroscopic evaluation, an anterior-inferior Bankart lesion, impaction of the humeral head with a minimal displaced GT fracture, and a partial RC tear were identified and successfully treated arthroscopically. The patient had immobilization in a simple sling for 6 weeks and he followed a standard 3-month physiotherapy protocol for rotator cuff, finally regaining almost normal range of shoulder motion at 1 year. Conclusions: Although very good results of non-operative treatment of LEH have been reported in the literature, the coexistence of intra-articular lesions such as labral and rotator cuff tears makes arthroscopic repair an attractive alternative in individual cases.

Distinctive Convergence Eye Movements in an Acquired Neurosensory Dysfunction	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						vergence eye movements; pupil regulation; human; objective diagnosis; video-oculography	US GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL; SYSTEMS-MODEL; PUPIL; SYMPTOMS; HAVANA	In late 2016, diplomats in Havana, Cuba, began presenting with a unique symptom complex after perceiving a strange noise and/or feeling a pressure field in their domicile. This report is a retrospective, quantitative analysis of video-oculography data of pupillary light reflex performance and binocular disparity-driven eye and pupil movements during the acute time period after the reported exposure. The patterns of response in these 19 individuals are markedly different than those seen in a group of individuals with the usual acute mild traumatic brain injury (17 subjects) and from 62 control subjects (21-60 years old) with no injury. Non-linear least squares regression was used to estimate the model parameters from the eye movement and the pupil measurements (1). Linear discriminant analysis was then used to identify a classifier for an objective discrimination of the groups with >91% accuracy and no confusion between the acute neurosensory findings among the members of the Havana diplomatic community and the subjects with acute mild traumatic brain injury. This pattern difference in eye and pupil behavior may be a useful screen to help objectively distinguish blunt trauma from Havana-type effects in the future and to guide the affected individuals to appropriate care.

Although surgery is one of the most important treatments, the surgery for SCIWORA is controversial, especially the time of surgery is a topic of controversy. Here, we investigate the effects of difference in duration from injury to surgery on the outcome of SCIWORA.MethodsThis retrospective study was performed in all patients with spinal cord injury admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University from January 2013 to April 2017. Fifty-seven patients who met the study requirements were divided into 3 groups according to the duration from injury to surgery. Group A (surgery within 3days of injury) had 18 patients, group B (surgery within 3-7days) had 18 patients, and group C (surgery later than 7days) had 21 patients. All the groups were compared with Mann-Whitney U test; the functional improvement of spinal cord was compared and analyzed using the ASIA sports score and ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS).ResultsThere was a significant improvement in the long-term AIS (final follow-up) in all the 3 groups compared to before surgery. The final follow-up recovery rate of group C was worse than group A and group B. The curative effect of operation within 7days was significantly better than the surgery done 7days later. The recovery rate of group C was worse than group A and B. The ASIA sports score showed that recovery was quicker in the early stage and slow in the later stage.ConclusionsThe optimal schedule of surgical treatment was 3-7days after injury, which can significantly improve the short-term and long-term follow-up effects. Longer the time to surgery from the time of injury, the worse was the prognosis.

Pharmacological inhibition of lipid peroxidative damage by the 21-aminosteroid U-74389G improves cortical mitochondrial function following traumatic brain injury in young adult male rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury (TBI); Lazaroid; U-74389G; Mitochondria; 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE); Acrolein	ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; CYTOCHROME-C RELEASE; MEDIATED CYTOSKELETAL DEGRADATION; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT CHAIN; SPINAL-CORD MITOCHONDRIA; VEHICLE-CONTROLLED TRIAL; INDUCED OXIDATIVE DAMAGE; DOSE TIRILAZAD MESYLATE; FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM TRAUMA	The 21-aminosteroid ("lazaroid") U-74389G (U74), an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation (LP), was used to protect mitochondrial function following TBI in young adult male rats. The animals received a severe (2.2 mm) controlled cortical impact-TBI. U74 was administered intravenous at 15 min and 2 h post injury (hpi) followed by intraperitoneal dose at 8 hpi at the following doses (mg/kg): 0.3 (IV) + 1 (IP), 1 + 3, 3 + 10, 10 + 30. Total cortical mitochondria were isolated at 72 hpi and respiratory rates were measured. Mitochondrial 4-HNE and acrolein were evaluated as indicators of LP-mediated oxidative damage. At 72 h post-TBI injured animals had significantly lower mitochondrial respiration rates compared to sham. Administration of U74 at the 1 mg/kg dosing paradigm significantly improved mitochondrial respiration rates for States II, III, V(II) and RCR compared to vehicle-treated animals. At 72 h post-TBI injured animals administration of U74 also reduced reactive aldehydes levels compared to vehicle-treated animals. The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that interrupting secondary oxidative damage via acute pharmacological inhibition of LP by U74 following a CCI-TBI would provide mitochondrial neuroprotective effects in a dose-dependent manner. We found acute administration of U74 to injured rats resulted in improved mitochondrial function and lowered the levels of reactive aldehydes in the mitochondria. These results establish not only the most effective dose of U74 treatment to attenuate LP-mediated oxidative damage, but also set the foundation for further studies to explore additional neuroprotective effects following TBI.

Methods Eleven individuals participated in this crossover study involving the following interventions in a randomized order: group yoga-based physical therapy (YPT), conventional physical therapy (CPT), and group seated rest in a relaxing environment (SR). HRV and self-reported anxiety and fatigue were measured immediately before and after each group, and sleep after each condition and at baseline. Data was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with repeated measures. Results The interaction between time and treatment was statistically significant (p= .0203). For the SR treatment, wake after sleep onset (WASO) rate was reduced from 14.99 to 10.60 (IRR = 0.71;p= .006). Time and treatment were not found to be statistically significantly associated with any of the secondary outcomes. Conclusion Yoga-based physical therapy is feasible and safe in the inpatient rehabilitation setting following TBI. Sleep quality improved following the addition of a one-hour seated rest in a relaxing environment to a standard rehabilitation daily schedule, suggesting that structured rest time may be beneficial to sleep hygiene during inpatient rehabilitation following TBI.

Research design A pre-post test design was used. Methods and procedures Participants (N = 40 children and adolescents with concussion symptoms >2 weeks post-injury) were recruited from the concussion services at an urban children's rehabilitation hospital and the community. The program consisted of individualized low-intensity aerobic exercise, sport-specific drills, relaxation exercises and comprehensive education and support. The 6 week program was completed by participants in their home or local community with weekly check-ins with the research team. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear regressions. Main outcomes and results Outcome measures included the Beck Youth Inventories (youth), and the Child Behavior Checklist (parents). Results indicated significant improvements in anger and anxiety post-intervention with anger reduction being more pronounced in girls. Conclusions Active rehabilitation interventions may have positive effects on mood in youth recovering from concussion. Clinicians may wish to consider addressing anxiety and anger management strategies as part of comprehensive concussion management in youth.

A case series was conducted using data from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP). Children who were injured while travelling on land transportation for which child restraint is not required, who presented to a Canadian Emergency Department that participates in eCHIRPP between April 1, 1990 to August 29, 2016, were included. Overall, 1856 children sustained 2139 injuries (mean age: 9.8 years (SD 4.5), 45.5% male). The majority of children were injured on a school bus (49.3%). The most commonly injured body part was the head or neck (52.6%). The most common type of injury was a superficial or open wound (33.1%), followed by traumatic brain injury (19.3%). Overall, 39.4% of injuries required no treatment in hospital. Overall, approximately 70 children presented to eCHIRPP EDs per year on a land transportation vehicle that does not require restraints. Biomechanical studies are needed to improve safety on land transportation vehicles that do not require seatbelts.

J	Huffer, KW				Huffer, Kelly Watson			A convoluted concussion case	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						Concussion; interprofessional collaboration; management; Zurich protocol		Background:College health pracitioners are often the primary contact for students with concussion. The aim of this case report is to describe concussion management of a convoluted journey to recovery for a student over the course of an acadmic year. Case presentation:The case starts with an initial presenting event which is further complicated by repeated head traumas, co-morbid mental health conditions, and inconsistency with follow-up. Interprofessional collaboration and inclusion of the Zurich protocol eventually lead to resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:The emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach to the medical and academic progress is described. Identifying information was changed to protect the student.

Polyplex transfection from intracerebroventricular delivery is not significantly affected by traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE			English	Article						Non-viral gene delivery; Polymer; Central nervous system; Extracellular matrix	CELL-PROLIFERATION; HEPARAN-SULFATE; GENE DELIVERY; MIGRATION; NEUROGENESIS; POLYMER; MODELS	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is largely non-preventable and often kills or permanently disables its victims. Because current treatments for TBI merely ameliorate secondary effects of the initial injury like swelling and hemorrhaging, strategies for the induction of neuronal regeneration are desperately needed. Recent discoveries regarding the TBI-responsive migratory behavior and differentiation potential of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) have prompted strategies targeting gene therapies to these cells to enhance neurogenesis after TBI. We have previously shown that plasmid polyplexes can non-virally transfect SVZ NPCs when directly injected in the lateral ventricles of uninjured mice. We describe the first reported intracerebroventricular transfections mediated by polymeric gene carriers in a murine TBI model and investigate the anatomical parameters that dictate transfection through this route of administration. Using both luciferase and GFP plasmid transfections, we show that the time delay between injury and polyplex injection directly impacts the magnitude of transfection efficiency, but that overall trends in the location of transfection are not affected by injury. Confocal microscopy of quantum dot-labeled plasmid uptake in vivo reveals association between our polymers and negatively charged NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of the SVZ extracellular matrix. We further validate that glycosaminoglycans but not sulfate groups are required for polyplex uptake and transfection in vitro. These studies demonstrate that non-viral gene delivery is impacted by proteoglycan interactions and suggest the need for improved polyplex targeting materials that penetrate brain extracellular matrix to increase transfection efficiency in vivo.

Garrett; McDonald, Matthew; Tkach, Shaun; Hamilton, John; Heigle, Gregory; Hollabaugh, Kimberly; Teague, David; Rowles, Douglas			Prevalence of ligamentous knee injuries in pedestrian versus motor vehicle accidents	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT; DISLOCATION; TRAUMA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RELIABILITY; ACCURACY	Background The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of ligamentous knee injuries and to compare patient demographics, associated injuries and hospital stay to pedestrians who did not sustain a ligamentous knee injury. Methods A retrospective review of all adult patients presenting as pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle to a level 1 trauma center over a three-year period was performed. Demographics, length of stay, orthopedic and non-orthopedic traumatic injuries were recorded. Magnetic resonance imaging was reviewed for ligamentous, bony and chondral injuries. Results Five hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Sixty-seven (12.4%) patients sustained a total of 84 ligamentous knee injuries. OF these knee injuries that had MRI (55/84), the majority (96%) were multi-ligamentous in nature. Patients with ligamentous knee injury were more likely to also be affected by traumatic brain injury, solid organ injury, cervical and lumbar spine injury, pelvic ring injuries, distal femur fractures, patella fractures, knee dislocations, tibial plateau fractures, tibial pilon fractures, and deep vein thrombosis when compared to patients who did not sustain ligamentous knee injury. Patients who sustained ligamentous knee injury were more likely to require hospital and intensive care admission and had a longer overall hospital stay. Conclusion Given the high prevalence of ligamentous knee injuries in this patient population, these patients should be thoroughly evaluated for a ligamentous knee injury. If ligamentous knee injury is suspected, MRI should be considered as a majority of these injuries involved multiple structures. Patients with ligamentous knee injuries often had multi-system injuries with resulting longer hospital stay when compared to those without ligamentous knee injuries.	[Steinmetz, R.

A diagnostic and prognostic neuromarker may optimize management and return-to-activity decision-making in athletes who experience mTBI. Objective Measure an event-related potential (ERP) component captured with electroencephalography (EEG), called processing negativity (PN), at baseline and post-injury in adolescents who suffered mTBI and determine their longitudinal response relative to healthy controls. Methods Thirty adolescents had EEG recorded during an auditory oddball task at a pre-mTBI baseline session and subsequent post-mTBI sessions. Longitudinal EEG data from patients and healthy controls (n= 77) were obtained from up to four sessions in total and processed using Brain Network Analysis algorithms. Results The average PN amplitude in healthy controls significantly decreased over sessions 2 and 3; however, it remained steady in the mTBI group's 2nd (post-mTBI) session and decreased only in sessions 3 and 4. Pre- to post-mTBI amplitude changes correlated with the time interval between sessions. Conclusion These results demonstrate that PN amplitude changes may be associated with mTBI exposure and subsequent recovery in adolescent athletes.

Participants We recruited 18 adolescent hockey players suffering from a SRC, and 19 age, sex and handedness-matched hockey players with no history of concussion. Main measure We asked participants to perform the Spatial Configuration Task (SCT), a computerized tool used to quantitatively measure the ability of the individuals to form cognitive maps. Results We found that athletes with a concussion performed significantly worse than controls on the SCT (F(1,34) = 5.82,p=.021,= -0.72), confirming a negative effect of a SRC on the ability to form cognitive maps. We found no significant difference between groups in average response time, and no significant correlation between participants' performance at the SCT and reported symptoms of concussion as rated on the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5). Conclusions Consistent with the integrity of extended neural networks required for effective spatial orientation and navigation, the findings of our pilot study provide preliminary evidence suggesting that a SRC may affect the ability to familiarize with a spatial surrounding and orient within it.

Emergency Medical Services Traumatic Brain Injury Protocols Do Not Reflect Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines	PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; knowledge translation; guidelines		Objectives:Implementation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) guideline recommendations for prehospital care is associated with improved outcomes, but prehospital guideline uptake is frequently delayed. Our objective was to estimate how well TBI guidelines are reflected in a national sample of prehospital TBI protocols in 2012 and 2018, 5 and 11 years after guideline publication.Methods:A purposeful sample of publicly accessible prehospital protocols were obtained in 2012, and updates of those protocols were obtained in 2018. Guideline recommendations were codified into a 23-item tool that was used to dual-abstract each prehospital protocol set. Descriptive statistics and chi-square testing were used to compare differences. Fifty-three sets of protocols representing 25 states and multiple administrative structures were identified.Results:None of the protocols contained all twenty-three elements of the guidelines, and more than one-third (19/53, 35%) did not have a TBI-specific protocol. While some individual items appeared more frequently in 2018 than 2012, more than half of the reviewed protocols do not contain guidance on ventilation or definitions of hypoxemia, hypotension, or pupil asymmetry.Conclusions:Evaluation of a diverse sample of EMS protocols demonstrates a significant deficit in the adoption of TBI guidelines more than a decade after publication.

Inflated scaled scores on the digital WISC-V coding subtest in a Canadian sample	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-CHILD			English	Article; Early Access						Computerized assessment; processing speed; test equivalence; Wechsler tests; WISC-V Coding	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PROCESSING SPEED; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; PROFILES; ADHD; DISABILITY; AUTISM; SKILLS	This study examined performance differences in the traditional paper-and-pencil and new digital versions of the Coding subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) using a cross-sectional sample. A total of 212 school-aged children between 6 and 14 years old were included in the sample, with 116 completing the paper version and 96 completing the digital version administered on a tablet in 2017-2018. One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference with large effect size between mean scaled scores, with the digital version resulting in higher scaled scores than the paper version,F(1, 210) = 67.57,p < 0.001,d = 1.14,eta(2)(p)= 0.24. That is, normed digital scores appear inflated as compared to paper scores. No difference in raw scores was observed when controlling for age,F(1, 209) = 0.54,p > 0.05. Post-hoc analyses were performed to account for potential confounds in demographic differences and to maximize group equivalence, with the same pattern of results. Findings have important implications for clinical interpretation of Coding scores when administering the digital version of the task. Clinicians, including psychologists and neuropsychologists, should be aware of the limitations of the new digital version of this subtest, including differences in standardized performance and task requirements. Future studies using random assignment and/or repeated-measures design are needed to replicate these findings.

Study design Online 97-item survey which addressed the practice of training both familiar and unfamiliar communication partners, and barriers and facilitators to implementation informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. Participants 169 Speech and Language Therapists from private and public settings in the UK. Results While 96% reported training familiar communication partners, only 58% reported training unfamiliar communication partners. Therapists reported providing communication partner training consistent with best practice 43% of the time. Evidence-based published programmes were used by 13.8% and 19.9% of participants for training familiar and unfamiliar partners, respectively. Therapists reported using outcomes for familiar and unfamiliar communication partners 83% and 78% of the time. The most frequently reported barrier was lack of behavioral regulation (e.g., planning). Most frequent perceived facilitators were clinicians wanting to deliver communication partner training and that training was part of therapists' professional role (social professional role and identity). Conclusions Therapists were motivated to deliver communication partner training but reduced capability affected implementation. Further support to clinicians on outcome measurement with materials to develop workplace systems to monitor implementation is needed.

It is acknowledged that patients undergoing neurosurgery with neurological illness are at higher risk of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). As an underlying life-threatening complication, the incidence and risk factors for high-risk patients with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis are still controversial in relative high-risk patients after neurosurgery.Materials and Methods. A total of 204 patients who underwent neurosurgery and were considered as a high-risk group of DVT according to times of stay in bed more than 3 days were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the lower extremity DVT by using Color Doppler Ultrasound System (CDUS). Clinical parameters of patients at the time of admission and postoperation were recorded and prepared for further analysis. Early predictive factors for postoperative lower extremity DVT were established. Diagnostic performance of predictive factors was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Results. The overall incidence rate of DVT in 204 enrolled patients was 30.9%. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that hypertension (OR 3.159, 95% CI 1.465-6.816;P=0.003), higher postoperative D-dimer (OR 1.225, 95% CI 1.016-1.477;P=0.034), female (OR 0.174, 95% CI 0.054-0.568;P=0.004), and lower GCS score (OR 0.809, 95% CI 0.679-0.965;P=0.013) were independently associated with incidence of DVT in patients after neurosurgery. The logistic regression function (LR model) of these four independent risk factors had a better performance on diagnostic value of DVT in patients after neurosurgery.Conclusion. The combined factor was constructed by hypertension, postoperative D-dimer, gender, and GCS score, and it might be a more handy and reliable marker to stratify patients at risk of DVT after neurosurgery.

The utility of the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination in inpatient rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury: preliminary findings	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Cognitive assessment; traumatic brain injury; psychometric evaluation; inpatient rehabilitation	MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; 3MS; DEMENTIA; STROKE; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; VALIDITY; SCALE; EXAM; MMSE	Objective The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) could provide useful information about cognitive status in traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet has not been validated in this population. We studied the reliability, construct validity, clinical responsiveness, and cognitive impairment classification-ability of the 3MS compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Methods Adult participants receiving inpatient rehabilitation services for TBI were administered the 3MS and MMSE at admission and discharge (n = 72). Construct validity and classification agreement were assessed through relationships of each measure with cognitive items of the Functional Independence Measure(TM)(FIM) and rehabilitation length of stay (LOS). Results 3MS reliability at admission and discharge (Cronbach's alphas = .871 and .839, respectively) exceeded that for the MMSE (Cronbach's alpha = .748 and .653, respectively). 3MS construct validity was marginally better than for the MMSE as assessed through correlations with FIM cognitive scores and LOS. Standard error of measurement as a percentage of the total scale was lower for the 3MS; responsiveness of the 3MS was superior as assessed by the 95% confidence interval for minimal detectable change. Cognitive impairment classification-ability was superior for the 3MS. Conclusions While both instruments had reasonable psychometric properties, the 3MS had a superior psychometric profile in the acute phase of TBI.

Testosterone, sex steroids, and aging in neurodegenerative disease after acquired brain injury: a commentary	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; testosterone; aging; chronic disease; neurodegenerative disease	HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; MIDDLE-AGED MEN; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; REPLACEMENT THERAPY; GROWTH-FACTOR; EXPRESSION; NEUROPROTECTION; HYPOPITUITARISM; HYPOGONADISM; DYSFUNCTION	Primary Objective Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with higher incidence of neurodegenerative disease and the effects of aging appear more pronounced after TBI. This paper examines the potential interaction of aging, TBI, and change in male testosterone production. Methods and Procedures An abbreviated review of literature documenting hypogonadism after TBI is provided. Potential mechanisms of endocrine dysgrasia associated with aging are reviewed as they relate and interact with endocrine change after TBI in males. These factors align to suggest the need for development of surveillance guidelines for male individuals living with TBI. Outcomes and Results The neuroprotectant, neuroactivation, growth, and cell therapy characteristics of testosterone in the central nervous system are considerable. Age-related decrements in testosterone production may be accelerated after TBI. Conclusions Testosterone deficiency in male individuals after TBI can be present after TBI or can develop during aging. Age-related decreases in testosterone production after TBI may act to amplify endocrine dysfunction after TBI. Ongoing clinical surveillance for testosterone deficiency associated with both TBI and aging may be reasonable.

Method Twenty-eight hospitalized children without brain injury, aged between 8 and 16 years treated with opiate analgesics for pain relief following surgery were tested on the Westmead PTA scale. Pain and stress levels were also self-reported each day. Results Only 29% (n = 7) of children assessed over four days obtained a maximum score of 12/12 on three consecutive days, thus 71% would have been deemed to have been in PTA when they were not. The percentage of children who obtained a maximum score significantly decreased over consecutive days of assessment, due to an increase in error rate on picture memory items. Self-reported pain and stress ratings were not correlated with PTA scores. Conclusions Opiate analgesia can disrupt performance on the Westmead PTA scale in school-aged children resulting in a high false-positive error rate. It is therefore important to record pain medication schedules and interpret results cautiously when opiate analgesia is used following a TBI. Alteration of the method of administration of the memory items should be researched as this may increase the validity of the scale for children with TBI treated with opiate analgesics.

J	Forrester, MB				Forrester, Mathias B.			Helium inhalation injuries managed at emergency departments	CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Helium; inhalation; injury; emergency department	AMERICAN ASSOCIATION; SUICIDE; SYSTEM; TRENDS	Introduction:Helium is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless inert gas. Inhaling helium can temporarily result in a high-pitched, squeaky voice. Individuals also may inhale helium to become intoxicated or commit suicide. The objective of this study was to characterize helium inhalations managed at emergency departments (EDs). Methods:Data were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a database of consumer product-related injuries collected from the EDs of approximately 100 United States hospitals. Helium inhalation-related injuries reported during 2000-2019 were identified by reviewing the record narratives for the term "helium." The distribution of the national estimate was determined for selected variables. Results:A total of 89 helium inhalation-related injuries were identified, resulting in a national estimate of 2,186 injuries. The estimated number of injuries was 99 during 2000-2004, 305 during 2005-2009, 864 during 2010-2014, and 918 during 2015-2019. The age distribution was 75 (3.4%) 0-5 years, 1,427 (65.3%) 6-12 years, 586 (26.8%) 13-19 years, and 98 (4.5%) 20 years or older; 1446 (66.1%) of the patients were male. The most commonly reported symptoms or injuries were 1500 (68.6%) syncope, 615 (28.1%) non-concussion head injury, 299 (13.7%) dizziness/lightheaded, 267 (12.2%) contusion/abrasion, and 236 (10.8%) concussion. The patient was treated or evaluated and released in 2149 (98.3%) estimated injuries. Conclusion:The majority of patients with helium inhalation-related injuries treated at United States EDs were age 6-12 years and male. Most of the patients experienced either syncope or dizziness/lightheadedness and were released from the ED.

Causal Link between Ventricular Ectopy and Concussion	CASE REPORTS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; AMIODARONE; NEUROCARDIOLOGY; DYSFUNCTION; DEPRESSION; MECHANISM; SYMPTOM; STRESS; TIME	We present a unique case study report of a male individual with a history of mild nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, with no ventricular ectopy, that at the age of 76 years sustained multiple concussions (i.e., mild traumatic brain injury) within a week of each other. Concussion symptoms included cognitive difficulties, "not feeling well," lethargy, fatigue, and signs of depression. He was later medically diagnosed with postconcussion syndrome. The patient, WJT, was referred for cardiac and neurological assessment. Structural neuroimaging of the brain (MRI) was unremarkable, but electrocardiography (ECG) assessments using a 24-hour Holter monitor revealed significant incidence of ventricular ectopy (9.4%; 9,350/99,836 beats) over a period of 5-6 months after injury and then a further increase in ventricular ectopy to 18% (15,968/88,189 beats) during the subsequent 3 months. The patient was then prescribed Amiodarone 200 mg, and his ventricular ectopy and concussion symptoms completely resolved simultaneously within days. To the authors' knowledge, our study is the first to show a direct link between observable and documented cardiac dysregulation and concussion symptomology. Our study has important implications for both cardiac patients and the patients that sustain a concussion, and if medically managed with appropriate pharmacological intervention, it can reverse ventricular ectopy and concussion symptomology. More research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms for this dramatic and remarkable change in cardiac and cerebral functions and to further explore the brain-heart interaction and the intricate autonomic interaction that exists between the extrinsic and intracardiac nervous systems.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a single center in Malaysia via recruiting care providers of patients with TBI. The modified caregiver strain index (MCSI) questionnaires were utilized to ascertain the level of strain. The demographic data of informal care providers were also obtained. Independent sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a linear regression model were processed for data analysis. Results: A total of 140 informal care providers were included in the study. More than half of informal care providers claimed to have strain (54.3%). Factors associated with increased strain include receiving tertiary education, being of Chinese background, and employed experience higher strain level. Informal care providers with characteristics such as being single, retired and provided care for 5 years experienced a lower level of strain.

Fatal intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from vitamin K deficiency in a 9-week-old infant	RECHTSMEDIZIN			German	Article						Intracranial bleeding; Shaken baby syndrome; Vitamin k deficiency bleeding; Prophylaxis	SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME; NONACCIDENTAL HEAD-INJURY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AXONAL INJURY; PROPHYLAXIS; PREVENTION	Intracranial hemorrhages in infants are rare but life-threatening events. Apart from vascular malformations, metabolic disorders and coagulopathies, nonaccidental trauma, in particular shaken baby syndrome must be taken into consideration. Clinical diagnostic tests and procedures to further evaluate the etiology of the hemorrhage include sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as imaging procedures as well as fundoscopy and laboratory tests, especially with respect to coagulation parameters. Fat-soluble vitamin K is essential for blood coagulation. A differentiation is made between classical and delayed hemorrhages due to vitamin K deficiency. In order to avoid an increased recurrence of bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency in neonates and young infants, an adequate clarification for the parents is necessary. A refusal of prophylaxis seems to be the result of an ideologically founded rejection of classical medicine and an increasing phenomenon in affluent industrial countries.

Placement of Surgical Feeding Tubes Among Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Requiring Exploratory Abdominal Surgery: Better Early Than Late	AMERICAN SURGEON			English	Article								Objectives The purpose of this study was to identify trauma patients who would benefit from surgical placement of an enteral feeding tube during their index abdominal trauma operation. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to 2 level I trauma centers between January 2013 and February 2018 requiring urgent exploratory abdominal surgery. Results Six-hundred and one patients required exploratory abdominal surgery within 24 hours of admission after trauma activation. Nineteen (3% of total) patients underwent placement of a feeding tube after their initial exploratory surgery. On multivariate analysis, an intracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale >= 4 (odds ratio [OR] = 9.24, 95% CI 1.09-78.26, P = .04) and a Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8 (OR = 4.39, 95% CI 1.38-13.95, P = .01) were associated with increased odds of requiring a feeding tube. All patients who required a feeding tube had an Injury Severity Score >= 15. While not statistically significant, patients with an open surgical feeding tube compared with interventional radiology/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement had lower median intensive care unit length of stay, fewer ventilator days, and shorter median total hospital length of stay. Conclusions Trauma patients with severe intracranial injury already requiring urgent exploratory abdominal surgery may benefit from early, concomitant placement of a feeding tube during the index abdominal operation, or at fascial closure.

J	Cozzi, L				Cozzi, Leslie			Metaphor to Metier: Kerry Tribe's "Aphasia Poetry Club" and the Discourse of Disability in Contemporary Art	ARTS			English	Article						aphasia; neurocognitive disability; contemporary video; contemporary film; Kerry Tribe; disability arts		"Metaphor to Metier: Kerry Tribe's Aphasia Poetry Club and the Discourse of Disability in Contemporary Art" explores a 2015 video work by Los Angeles-based artist Kerry Tribe. Tribe's "The Aphasia Poetry Club" embodies a shift in contemporary artistic discourse around concepts of physical and cognitive disability. Created by a neurotypical artist, the work uses the medium of the moving image to interpret the experience of aphasia, a neurocognitive language disorder frequently associated with traumatic brain injury. Three distinct visual idioms capture the particular neurological profiles and linguistic patterns of Tribe's chosen participants. Tribe's representation of people living with aphasia disrupts ableist conceits about the human capacity for memory and language. Rather than stigmatizing individual impairments, the work is indicative of a new aesthetic arising from disability experience. The article argues that disability no longer functions in the contemporary art world as a political or spiritual metaphor, but rather has become a site of formal invention and conceptual research.

Blood Conservation for Complex Spine and Intracranial Procedures	CURRENT ANESTHESIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Complex spine; Blood conservation; Tranexamic acid; ROTEM; Erythropoietin alfa	TRANEXAMIC ACID; ROTATIONAL THROMBOELASTOMETRY; RISK-FACTORS; VISUAL-LOSS; TRANSFUSION REQUIREMENTS; INTRAABDOMINAL PRESSURE; ORTHOPEDIC-SURGERY; OPERATIVE TIME; CELL SAVER; LUMBAR	Purpose of Review Neurological surgery, which includes intracranial and spine surgery, is associated with a significant risk of major perioperative bleeding. This review highlights the various blood conservation techniques currently in practice for major, complex spine and intracranial surgery. Recent Findings Several techniques have been described to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements perioperatively. These include preoperative risk identification and stratification and use of different blood conservation strategies perioperatively. The efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid has been demonstrated in major spine surgery, and its role has expanded in traumatic brain injury based on the CRASH-3 study. Permissive hypotension should be avoided based on recent high-quality observational data on the negative effects of cumulative hypotension on end-organ injury. The use of viscoelastic blood coagulation management is increasingly used as a theragnostic approach to blood conservation strategies. Summary The ability to minimize blood loss and reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions, which can greatly increase perioperative morbidity and mortality, is paramount. Our review provides a framework for evidence-based blood conservation strategies for neurological surgery.

J	Gupta, AD; Addison, S				Gupta, Anupam D.; Addison, Samantha			Healing hand ulcers caused by focal spasticity	INTERNATIONAL WOUND JOURNAL			English	Article						botulinum toxin; hand spasticity; ulcer	BOTULINUM-TOXIN; DISORDERS	Spasticity is a common manifestation of many upper motor neuron lesions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. In some cases, spastic fingers in the hand press hard into the palm, resulting in skin breakdown and atypical pressure ulcerations. We treated 10 such patients living in the nursing homes with long-standing treatment-resistant hand ulcers in our spasticity clinic first, with Botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) injection into the spastic muscles followed by dressing, splinting, and hand therapy. These ulcers failed to respond to standard treatment, causing significant pain, offensive smell, increased carer burden, and difficulty in maintaining hygiene as hands could barely be opened for dressing and therapy. We noted complete healing of ulcers with significant improvement in the following outcome measures-Modified Ashworth Scale for spasticity, Visual Analog Scale for pain, pressure ulcer grading for the ulcers, Fingertip to Palm distance for hand opening, Carer Burden Scale, and in the Goal Attainment Scale pre, 4 weeks, and 3 months postinjection with P values of .003, .003, .004, .005, .004, and .004, respectively. Reducing spasticity with BoNTA should be the first step in treating hand ulcerations caused by focal spasticity, followed by dressing, splinting, and hand therapy.

EPO treatment does not alter acute serum profiles of GFAP and S100B after TBI: A brief report on the Australian EPO-TBI clinical trial	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Erythropoietin; Biomarker; GFAP; S100B; TBI biomarker	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ERYTHROPOIETIN; BIOMARKERS	Purpose: To determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an Erythropoietin (EPO) clinical trial and examine whether EPO therapy reduces biomarker concentrations. Materials and Methods: Forty-four patients with moderate-to-severe TBI were enrolled to a sub-study of the EPO-TBI trial. Patients were randomized to either Epoetin alfa 40,000 IU or 1 ml sodium chloride 0.9 as subcutaneous injection within 24 h of TBI. Results: GFAP and S100B were measured in serum by ELISA from DO (within 24 h of injury, prior to EPO/vehicle administration) to D5. Biomarker concentrations were compared between injury severities, diffuse vs. focal TBI, 6-month outcome scores (GOS-E) and EPO or placebo treatments. At D0 GFAP was significantly higher than S100B (951 pg/mL vs. 476 pg/mL, p = 0.018). ROC analysis of S100B at 1D post-injury distinguished favorable vs. unfavorable outcomes (area under the curve = 0.73; p = 0.01). EPO did not reduce concentration of either biomarker. Conclusions: Elevated serum concentrations of GFAP and S100B after TBI reflect a robust, acute glial response to injury. Consistent with lack of improved outcome in TBI patients treated with EPO and prior findings on neuronal and axonal markers, glial biomarker concentrations and acute profiles were not affected by EPO.

J	Hennig, B; Gebhard, B; Hinrichs, R; Reutlinger, C				Hennig, Birgit; Gebhard, Britta; Hinrichs, Richard; Reutlinger, Constanze			An Explorative Study about Educational Pathways after a Moderate and Severe Traumatic Brain Injury	REHABILITATION			German	Article						Traumatic brain injury; transition process; scholastic rehabilitation; educational pathways; long term effects	SCHOOL; BACK	Purpose Empirical data on educational pathways after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are rare and obsolete. Less is known about the success of executed initial recommendations and the following school career. This study examines the course of school career after a moderate to severe TBI. In particular, based on the school recommendations at the end of inpatient rehabilitation, the linearity or nonlinearity of the processes and the long-term success in the educational system should be understood. Methods The sample included 49 students. We analysed descriptive clinical data, school-related recommendations and standardised questionnaires for evaluating scholastic reintegration. 2-9 years later a standardized questionnaire was used to evaluate the outcome and success of the course in the school system. The analysis is based on descriptive statistics due to Stata 15.1. Results 59,2 % of the respondents returned in their former school class immediately after hospital discharge. 24,5 % initially changed the educational institution. All in all, there were changes and ruptures in more than a half of the cases as aftereffect of the TBI. Conclusion The results of the study are discussed regarding the discontinuities in school careers. The study confirms a high level of breaks and nonlinearity in the scholastic pathway after a moderate to severe TBI. Recommendations of the rehabilitation clinic appear helpful, but they are no guarantee for an obstacle-free re-education. Professional guidance in the process of school re-habilitation is recommended. The results of the study verify the requirement of a professional, systemic and individualized follow-up care in each particular school context. More empirical research about courses of TBI in the school system is needed to identify the aspects, which increase the risks of disruptions or prevents the fitting in the school career and to identify the aspects which support the success of fitting for the individual student.

We established rat models of hemorrhagic shock (HS), multiple injury (MI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) to investigate the diversity of traumatic coagulopathy, especially platelet dysfunction. Methods: Seventy male SD rats were divided randomly into seven groups(n = 10): control, HS30min, HS3h, MI30min, MI3h, TBI30min and TBI3h. Plasma or whole blood was collected for conventional coagulation tests, thromboelastography and platelet mapping. X-ray, 7T magnetic resonance imaging and hematoxylin-eosin staining of injured tissues were conducted to confirm the injuries of rats model. Results: The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPIT) prolonged significantly in HS30min and MI3h groups, compared with those in control (P = 0.0403 and P = 0.0076, respectively). R values decreased in HS30min and HS3h groups, compared with those in control (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The maximum amplitude (MA) were 71.8 +/- 0.6 mm, 71.9 +/- 0.5 mm, 71.8 +/- 0.7 mm, 70.0 +/- 0.7 mm, 72.6 +/- 0.9 mm, 70.4 +/- 0.9 mm in HS30min, HS3h, MI30min, MI3h, TBI30min and TBI3h groups respectively, which were lower than those in control (P = 0.0304, P = 0.0205, P = 0.0431, P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0066, respectively). The platelet counts were 539 +/- 46 x 10(9)/L, 523 +/- 31 x 10(9)/L, 629 +/- 18 x 10(9)/L and 636 +/- 20 x 10(9)/L in HS30min, HS3h, MI3h and TBI3h groups respectively, which were lower than those in control (P = 0.0040, P = 0.0001, P = 0.0127 and P = 0.0232, respectively). The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibition rate decreased in HS30min group, compared with that in control (P = 0.0355). While, ADP inhibition rate increased in HS(3h )and TBI3h groups (P = 0.0041 and P = 0.0433 vs. control, respectively). The arachidonic acid (AA) inhibition rate increased in MI30min and MI3h groups, compared with control (P = 0.0029 and P = 0.0185, respectively). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that it might be the failure of forming a strong clot instead of the prolonged clot time, which contributed to traumatic coagulopathy. The platelet dysfunctions might contribute to trauma-induced coagulopathy in different ways. The loss of platelets might be the main reason for HS-induced coagulopathy. While, AA-dependent pathway inhibition might account for MI-induced coagulopathy. ADP-dependent pathway inhibition might be the major contributor for TBI-induced coagulopathy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In Romania, the annual incidence shows, that for every 100,000 inhabitants, there are 300 cases of craniocerebral trauma that require specialised medical assistance. Craniocerebral traumas are the most common types of traumas encountered in current forensic practice. Research on the mechanisms of injury. the timing of head trauma and the establishment of causes of death remain relevant. Establishing the traumatic moment implies both the distinction between pre-mortem and post-mortem injuries but also considerations regarding the post-traumatic survival interval. Regarding the elucidation of the moment of occurrence of the craniocerebral trauma from the forensic point of run), a satisfactory result has not been reached so for. The classic hypothesis regarding the development of traumatic brain injuries shows that they are the result of primary traumatic injuries due to cell necrosis combined with the inflammatory brain response that causes secondary brain injuries. It was considered that post-traumatic neuronal losses are strictly due to necrosis and inflammation, and cellular apoptosis being a physiological process, does not play a role in this process. Due to recent experimental data, brain cell apoptosis has begun to be reevaluated. The pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury is : far from being fully understood, with the idea that apoptosis would play an even more important role than originally thought. Specifically, damaged brain cells release neuromodulatory substances that can lead to late-onset neuronal damage long after necrotic and inflammatory brain phenomena have ceased to act. These neuronal cell losses are responsible for the development of various neurological deficits and post-traumatic sequelae.

While the neurophysiological effects caused by micro traumas to the brain have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the psychological consequences. This article reports on our study of the features of mental operations efficiency in Ukrainian boxers. The study involved athletes (n = 168, gender: men, average age: 25.5 +/- 6.2 years), who were engaged in boxing and kickboxing in the Ukraine's eastern region. A 'Classification' method was used: a set of 70 cards with the images of various objects, plants, and living beings was given with instructions to arrange the items into groups in such a way that the objects in each concrete group possess common properties. Athletes were divided into groups, depending on the level of their sport qualification. Adopting the Vygotskian perspective, this study shows correlations between the productivity of boxers' thinking processes and the level of their sport skills: highly qualified sportsmen have many more well-marked thinking process defects than the sportsmen of the 2nd and 3rd categories. We observed a decrease in the generalization level, reduction in speed, deterioration of neurodynamic characteristics and criticality processes nearly in all participants. Exhaustibility and decrease in mental working capacity, impulsiveness of thinking, and its unproductive transformation were marked more often among the highly skilled boxers. A discussion on the cultural redefinition of this sport and on the necessary rehabilitative treatments is then presented.

Harikishore			Cognitive Impairment in Moderate Degree Diffuse Axonal Head Injuries: Analysis of 84 Cases Using MMSE	INDIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						head injury; diffuse axonal injury; cognitive impairment; Mini-Mental Status Examination	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ASSOCIATION; SEQUELAE; DEFICITS; WORK	Background Cognitive impairment is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury survivors. Posttraumatic cognitive sequelae may be more devastating than focal motor and focal sensory deficits, and are usually left unattended. Aim and Objective Aim of this study was to assess cognitive impairment in patients who had sustained moderate degree diffuse axonal injuries and having good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score of 5). Methods and Materials Prospective observational study was done from 2011 to 2015 on the patients who had sustained moderated degree diffuse brain injuries. Eighty-four cases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were studied. Patients were assessed with Mini-Mental Status Examination at discharge, end of 1 month, and at 3 months. Result Seventy-six were males and 8 were females. Age ranged from 16 to 49 years. Note that 4.76% (4) patients had hypotension at presentation, 32.14% (27) patients had associated injuries, and 19.04% (16) patients had hyponatremia at presentation. Diabetes mellitus was seen in 34.52% (29) patients, while hypertension was seen in 14.28% (12). At 3 months' follow-up, 19.06% (16) patients had cognitive impairment. The present study revealed that hypotension and presence of associated injuries at presentation raises the odds of having cognitive impairment by 8 and 5 times, respectively. Conclusion Routine assessment of cognitive impairment in head injury survivors is essential as it may help in identifying cognitive deficits. Early intervention of neurorehabilitation to such patients results in better neurocognitive outcome. Hypotension and associated injuries are associated with poor cognitive outcome.

Because of its predilection for brain systems underlying cognitive and complex behavioral operations, it may cause chronic and severe psychiatric illness that requires expert management. This is more so for the modern epidemic of athletic and military brain injuries which are dominated by psychiatric symptoms. Past medical, including psychiatric, history, and comorbidities are important and relevant for formulation and management. Traumatic brain injury is a model for other neuropsychiatric disorders and may serve as an incubator of new ideas for neurodegenerative disease.

At an emergency hospital, he was diagnosed with cerebral concussion, incomplete cervical cord injury, C6 fracture, facial bone fractures, and lacerations. Radiographical findings indicated that his neck was forced into an extended position. At our rehabilitation hospital, we evaluated the patient's hoarseness and dysphagia 1 month posttrauma and determined the diagnosis to be due to "traumatic right recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP)." We followed the patient's RLNP during admission and at our outpatient clinic. His right RLNP gradually recovered and finally disappeared 6 months after the accident. We describe this case within the context of a review of the literature.

J	Koschmann, A				Koschmann, A.			Estimating drivers of concussions from punt returns in professional American football	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Concussions; Punt returns; Football; Propensity scoring		Objectives: To estimate drivers of concussions during punt kick returns in football and consider rule change incentives to potentially reduce concussions. Study design: The design of the study was to analyze concussions during punt returns. Methods: National Football League data of all punts from the 2016 and 2017 seasons are examined using propensity score matching (PSM) to estimate the causal effect of punt returns on the likelihood of a player concussion. Results: The PSM logistic regression estimates that the odds of a concussion increase 8.31, or are 731% higher, when a punt is returned versus not returned (log-odds b = 2.118, P < .001). Punt distance increases punt return likelihood, but time left in the game and the yard line where the punt is received reduces punt return likelihood. Conclusions: Returning a punt substantially increases the risks of a concussion. To reduce concussions in football, incentives should encourage punters to not make the punt returnable and encourage punt returners to not return the punt.

Head impact exposures in women's collegiate rugby	PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE			English	Article						Rugby; concussion; subconcussive; head impacts; women; concussive risk; athletic injuries	INJURIES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONCUSSIONS; FOOTBALL; PLAYERS; SEASON; LEAGUE; TEAM	Objectives To describe the incidence, magnitude, and distribution of head impacts and track concussions sustained in a collegiate level women's rugby season. Methods Data on head impact incidence and magnitude were collected via Smart Impact Monitors (SIM) (Triax Technologies, Inc., Norwalk, CT) within fitted headbands during practices and games of one competitive season. Magnitude data included peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational velocity (PRV) measurements and were reported as median [IQR]. Results Players sustained 120 head impacts >= 15 g (18.1 g - 78.9 g) with 1199 total athlete exposures. In eight games, 67 head impacts were recorded with a mean rate of 0.40 +/- 0.22 hits per-player per-match, median PLA of 32.2 g, and PRV of 13.5 rad(.)sec(-1). There were 53 head impacts in 47 practices with a mean rate of 0.05 +/- 0.04 hits per-player per-practice, median PLA of 29.8 g and PRV of 15.7 rad(.)sec(-1). Four concussions were reported and monitored. Conclusion The incidence and magnitude of head impacts in collegiate level women's rugby over one season of practices and games were fewer than those reported in other comparable studies. These findings give insight into the impact burden that female collegiate rugby athletes withstand throughout a competitive season.

J	Lee, HF; Chen, CH; Chang, CF				Lee, Hung-Fu; Chen, Chih Hung; Chang, Che-Feng			A Preclinical Controlled Cortical Impact Model for Traumatic Hemorrhage Contusion and Neuroinflammation	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article							BRAIN-INJURY; RAT MODEL; DAMAGE	Cerebral contusion is a severe medical problem affecting millions of people worldwide each year. There is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiological mechanism and to develop effective therapeutic strategy for this devastating neurological disorder. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage and post-traumatic inflammatory response induced by initial physical impact can aggravate microglia/macrophage activation and neuroinflammation which subsequently worsen brain pathology. We provide here a controlled cortical impact (CCI) protocol that can reproduce experimental cortical contusion in mice by using a pneumatic impactor system to deliver mechanical force with controllable magnitude and velocity onto the dural surface. This preclinical model allows researchers to induce moderately severe focal cerebral contusion in mice and to investigate a wide range of post-traumatic pathological progressions including hemorrhage contusion, microglia/macrophage activation, iron toxicity, axonal injury, as well as short-term and long-term neurobehavioral deficits. The present protocol can be useful for exploring the long-term effects of and potential interventions for cerebral contusion.

Evaluation of Impulse Attenuation by Football Helmets in the Frequency Domain	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						helmet evaluation; frequency domain; transmissibility; mechanical impedance; mild traumatic brain injury	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; HIGH-SCHOOL; CONCUSSION; TRANSMISSIBILITY; PLAYERS; SPORTS	Design of helmets used in contact sports has been driven by the necessity of preventing severe head injuries. Manufacturing standards and pass or fail grading systems ensure protective headgear built to withstand large impacts, but design standards do no account for impacts resulting in subconcussive episodes and the effects of cumulative impacts on its user. Thus, it is important to explore new design parameters, such as the frequency-domain measures of transmissibility and mechanical impedance that are based on energy absorption from a range of impact loads. Within the experimentally determined frequency range of interest (FROI), transmissibilities above unity were found in the 0-40 Hz range with the magnitude characteristics varying considerably with impact location. A similar variability with location was observed for the mechanical impedance, which ranged from 9 N/m to 50 N/m. Additional research is required to further understand how changes in the components or materials of the components will affect the performance of helmets, and how they may be used to reduce both transmissibility and dynamic impedance.

Cardiac-cerebral-renal associations in pediatric traumatic brain injury: Preliminary findings	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Children; Myocardial injury; Tachycardia; Traumatic brain injury; Troponin	TROPONIN-I; DYSFUNCTION; PLASMA	Objective: The clinical epidemiology of organ outcomes in pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been examined. We describe associated markers of cerebral, cardiac and renal injury after pediatric TBI. Design: Prospective observational study. Patients: Children 0-18 years who were hospitalized with TBI. Measurements: Measures of myocardial (at least one elevated plasma troponin [cTnI] >= 0.4 ng/ml) and multiorgan (hemodynamic variables, cerebral perfusion, and renal) function were examined within the first ten days of hospital admission and within 24 h of each other. Main Results: Data from 28 children who were 11 [IQR 10.3] years, male (64.3%), with isolated TBI (67.9%), injury severity score (ISS) 25[10], and admission Glasgow coma score (GCS) 11[9] were examined. Overall, 50% (14 children) had elevated cTnI, including those with isolated TBI (57.9%; 11/19), polytrauma (33.3%; 3/9), mild TBI (57.1% 8/14), and severe TBI (42.9%; 6/11). Elevated cTnI occurred within the first six days of admission and across all age groups, in both sexes, and regardless of TBI lesion type, GCS, and ISS. Age-adjusted admission tachycardia was associated with cTnI elevation (AUC 0.82; p < 0.001). Reduced urine output occurred more commonly in patients with isolated TBI (27.3% elevated cTnI vs. 0% normal cTnI). Conclusions: Myocardial injury commonly occurs during the first six days after pediatric TBI irrespective of injury severity, age, sex, TBI lesion type, or polytrauma. Age-adjusted tachycardia may be a clinical indicator of myocardial injury, and elevated troponin may be associated with cardio-cerebro-renal dysfunction. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Reports on neurodevelopmental outcomes in paediatric TBI suffer from small sample size and varying outcome definitions in the neurocognitive domains tested. This protocol describes a systematic review and meta-analysis of paediatric TBI in the following key neurocognitive domains: executive function, perceptual-motor function, language, learning and memory, social cognition and complex attention. Methods A comprehensive search comprising studies from Medline, Cochrane, Embase and PsycINFO published from 1988 to 2019 will be conducted. We will include studies on children <= 18 years old who suffer from mild, moderate and severe TBI as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale that report neurocognitive outcomes in domains predetermined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition criteria. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, case-control, cohort and cross-sectional studies will be included. References from systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be hand-searched for relevant articles. A meta-analysis will be performed and effect sizes will be calculated to summarise the magnitude of change in each neurocognitive domain compared at different timepoints and stratified by severity of TBI. Included studies will be pooled using pooled standardised mean differences with a random effects model to determine an overall effect. In the scenario that we are unable to pool the studies, we will perform a narrative analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for this study.The authors of this study will publish and present the findings in a peer-reviewed journal as well as national and international conferences. The results of this study will provide understanding into the association between different severities of paediatric TBI and long-term neurocognitive outcomes.

We present the case of a 55-year-old woman who had been previously submitted to several neurosurgical procedures aimed at treating idiopathic hydrocephalus. She presented to our department with recurring episodes of hypothermia and wide blood pressure variations, which had been worsening over the last few years. After extensive complementary workup, which excluded new neurological lesions or endocrinological conditions, hypothalamic dysfunction was assumed to be the cause of this syndrome. She was successfully treated with midodrine and on-demand captopril, which resulted in adequate control of her blood pressure. This case highlights the rare and unpredictable consequences of damage to the hypothalamus, depicting the favourable result of a heretofore unpublished medical approach.

A large degloving wound with herniating cerebrum was seen in the right parietotemporal region. A CT scan confirmed a large 8-cm skull defect. The patient was taken for irrigation and debridement, but due to significant tissue loss, the skin could not be closed. CSF leaked from the wound, and two additional operations for attempted closure were undertaken but failed. The plastic surgery team was consulted, but no closure was done because of the procedure's complexity, lack of resources, and cost. CSF diversion could not be performed due to no available lumbar catheter or external ventricular drain. Meningitis developed, leading to severe hyponatremia and death. The current case highlights both the unique mechanism of a hyena bite requiring neurosurgical intervention and the realities of practicing neurosurgery in a low-resource setting.

The aim of our study is to ascertain the role of serum albumin as a predictor of outcome in severe head injury patients. Materials and Methods This is a prospective observational study of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Depending on the serum albumin level at admission, patients were dichotomized into two groups: one with normal serum albumin and other with hypoalbuminemia. Their outcomes at 6-month follow-up were assessed by the modified Glasgow Outcome Score. Result Eighty patients (57 males and 23 females) with severe TBI were included in the study. The mean age of the study patients was 39.6 + 13.1 years and the mean serum albumin level at admission was 3.7 + 1.2 g/dL with lowest being 2.2 mmol/L and highest being 6.1 mmol/L. Thirty-four patients (42.5%) had low serum albumin level (< 3.5 g/dL) at admission. At 6-month follow-up, 58 (72.5%) patients had a good neurological outcome and 22 (27.5%) had a poor outcome. The group with normal serum albumin levels showed a significantly better outcome compared with the hypoalbuminemia group (p= 0.01). On multiple regression analysis, low serum albumin emerged as the only predictor of the poor outcome in severe head injury patients. Conclusion Serum albumin at admission is an independent predictor of outcome in severe TBI patients. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

Patients with neurocritical injuries account for 10-16 % of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions and frequently require neuromonitoring. Objective. To describe the current status of neuromonitoring in Argentina. Methods. Survey with 37 questions about neuromonitoring without including patients' data. Period: April-June 2017. Results.Thirty-eight responses were received out of 71 requests (14 districts with 11498 annual discharges). The PICU/hospital bed ratio was 21.9 (range: 4.2-66.7). Seventy-four percent of PICUs were public; 61%, university-affiliated; and 71%, level I. The availability of monitoring techniques was similar between public and private (percentages): intracranial pressure (95), electroencephalography (92), transcranial Doppler (53), evoked potentials (50), jugular saturation (47), and bispectral index (11). Trauma was the main reason for monitoring. Conclusion. Except for intracranial pressure and electroencephalography, neuromonitoring resources are scarce and active neurosurgery availability is minimal. A PICU national registry is required.

The aim of this study was to introduce cut-off scores for detecting poor performance using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in psy-chiatric patients. Methods Participants were 261 in-and out-patients who visited psychiatry department. They were classified into 4 group-1) military service, 2) traumatic brain injury (TBI), 3) psychosis, 4) neurosis. A Digit Span subtest (called as Reliable Digit Span, RDS) of WAIS was used to detect malingering. This study considered a score of 10% base rate as RDS cut-off score. Results The RDS cut-off score was shown at 7 pts for military service group, at 3 pts for TBI group, at 6 pts for psychosis group, and at 6 pts for neurosis group. Conclusion This study first introduced RDS cut-off scores for malingering psychiatric patients in South Korea. In clinical practice, cli-nicians may be able to utilize the RDS cut-off scores for malingering-suspected patients. In particular, for patients with military service issues, 7 or less pts of RDS can be used for detecting and inferring their malingering.

Methods: The retrospective study was conducted at Al Rass General Hospital, Saudi Arabia, and comprised medical records of all traumatic brain injury patients admitted to the Neurosurgery Department between November, 2017, and January, 2018. Data was noted using a proforma. Literature review was done to ascertain best clinical evidence and proposed guidelines for practice. Results: Of the 26 patients, 23(88.5 %) were males, and 3(11.5 %) were females. The overall mean age was 32.2?13.4 years. Of the total, 8(30.8%) patients had mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, while 1(3.8%) received enoxaparin as chemoprophylaxis. There were no reported thromboembolic events or complications related to enoxaparin usage. Conclusion: The usage of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was found to be low in clinical practice. A modified Parkland Model approach seemed the most appropriate to avoid venous thromboembolism related events.

J	Rouzbahani, A; Khodadadi, E; Fooladi, M				Rouzbahani, Abbas; Khodadadi, Esmail; Fooladi, Marjaneh			Impact of Mild Hypothermia on Final Outcome of Patients with Acute Stroke: A Randomized Clinical Trial	INDIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						hypothermia; stroke; randomized clinical trial; disease outcome	SCORE COMA SCALE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; DECOMPRESSIVE CRANIECTOMY; CARDIAC-ARREST; VALIDITY; RELIABILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COMBINATION; VALIDATION	Background and Aim Stroke is a sudden neurological disorder caused by disturbances in the brain blood flow and loss of normal brain function. Stroke is also the second leading cause of death worldwide. In the last two decades, among the various treatment options for stroke, hypothermia has shown the promise of improving the final outcome. This study aimed to investigate the effect of noninvasive hypothermia on the final outcome of patients with an acute stroke in Iran. Methods In a randomized clinical trial, 60 Iranian patients diagnosed with acute stroke were enrolled in 2018. Patients were selected by convenience sampling method and then randomized in two groups as experimental (n= 30) and control (n= 30). Mild hypothermia was applied using a cooling device for 72 hours on the patients' heads and intervention results were compared with the control group. Data were collected by using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III), Full Outline of Un-Responsiveness (FOUR), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and later analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22. ResultsNo significant difference was found in the mean scores of all three scales before and after the intervention in control group (p> 0.05) but statistically significant difference was found in the mean scores of all three scales for the intervention group (p< 0.05). The intervention group had an increased mean score in FOUR, while APACHE and NIHSS values dropped. Researchers found statistically significant difference between the mean scores after the intervention in the experimental group compared with the control group in all three scales (p< 0.05). Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that hypothermia has a significant statistical and clinical effect on the acute stroke outcome and it can be argued that hypothermia therapy can increase the level of consciousness and reduce the risk of death in stroke patients.

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between hospital ownership type and children's hospital designation with primary outcomes. METHODS This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2006, 2009, and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database. Primary outcomes, including inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and favorable discharge disposition, were assessed for all pediatric neurosurgery patients who underwent a neurosurgical procedure and were discharged with a primary diagnosis of accidental traumatic brain injury. RESULTS Private, not-for-profit hospitals (OR 2.08, p = 0.034) and freestanding children's hospitals (OR 2.88, p = 0.004) were predictors of favorable discharge disposition. Private, not-for-profit hospitals were also associated with reduced inpatient mortality (OR 0.34, p = 0.005). A children's unit in a general hospital was associated with a reduction in hospital LOS by almost 2 days (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Management at freestanding children's hospitals correlated with more favorable discharge dispositions for pediatric patients with accidental trauma who underwent neurosurgical procedures. Management within a children's unit in a general hospital was also associated with reduced LOS. By hospital ownership type, private, not-for-profit hospitals were associated with decreased inpatient mortality and more favorable discharge dispositions.

We investigated the demographics and comorbidities of neurological patients followed up in a PC center (PCC), and their effect on hospitalization period and discharge status. Materials and Methods: The medical records of 175 patients followed up in the PCC were reviewed retrospectively. Neurologic disorders were classified as stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), neurologic system tumors, brain hypoxia, dementia, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and other diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis). Age, sex, PCC length of hospital stay (LOS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), nutritional status [oral, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)], tracheostomy, pressure ulcer, and discharge status were compared for the patients. Results: The diagnoses of the patients whose average age was 66.58 +/- 19.97 years and LOS was 35.63 +/- 41.93 days were most often stroke and dementia (45.7% and 17%, respectively). In patients with PEG and tracheostomy, LOS in PCC was significantly longer, and patients with tracheostomy had a higher discharge rate. GCS was significantly lower in patients with TBI, whereas the home discharge rate was determined to be higher. Furthermore, age and GCS values of patients whose discharge status was exitus were found to be significantly higher. Conclusion: Even though neurologic diseases represent the most common patient population after cancer in need of PC, there are insufficient studies for describing the characteristics of this population, meeting their needs, and increasing awareness in this area.

In this regard, a MATLAB code is developed to homogenize a random distribution of neurons in the extracellular matrix. To create the RVE, different inputs including the size of RVE, the number of neurons, the radius of the neuron cell body, the coordinates of the axon and dendrites of a neuron, the radius of the axon and dendrites, and the minimum distance between the cellular volumes are considered. Then, a PYTHON code is developed which generates the desired RVE in ABAQUS employing the outputs of the MATLAB code. Also, a viscoelastic material model is considered for material components of the cerebral cortex tissue in this study. To analyze the developed RVE, some relaxation tests are performed on the RVE. Strain rate, neuron volume fraction (NVF), loading time and neuron distribution are investigated in different stress relaxation tests on the developed RVEs. Considering the NVF of 1, 2 and 3%, it is concluded that the maximum tensile and compressive stresses rise by increasing the NVF. Also, the results demonstrate that different irregular distributions of neurons have no effect on the bulk mechanical properties of the tissue for a constant NVF and only affect the distribution of local stresses (and even the maximum stress) in the tissue. Finally, the numerical simulations revealed that the developed RVE is a robust element which can be employed in realistic model of the brain tissue in different loading conditions such as trauma.

Methods Thirteen male pigs were divided into a sham group (n = 5) and TCA group (n = 8). Animals in the sham-operated group underwent intubation and monitoring but not haemorrhage and resuscitation, while animals in the TCA group underwent 40% blood volume haemorrhage over 20 min followed by 5 min of ventricular fibrillation and 5 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with fluid resuscitation. Results Restoration of spontaneous circulation was achieved in seven of eight animals in the TCA group. After resuscitation, the heart rate was significantly increased while the mean arterial pressure and ejection fraction were significantly decreased in the TCA group. The TCA group had significant cardiac and neurological injuries post-resuscitation and had higher serum creatinine and blood lactic acid levels and lower PaO(2)than the sham group. Animals in the TCA group also exhibited significantly higher apoptotic indices and caspase-3 protein levels in the heart, brain and kidney than the sham group. Conclusion Animals in this swine model of TCA exhibited high rates of successful resuscitation, significant vital organ injury and prolonged survival. The model is suitable for use in further TCA research.

Methods We retrospectively enrolled patients with a history of facial trauma and who underwent both facial CT and brain CT. Two reviewers independently measured ONST and ONSD of each patient using facial CT images. Final brain CT with clinical outcome was used as the reference standard for TBI. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and intraclass correlation coefficients were used for statistical analyses. Results Both ONST (P=0.002) and ONSD (P=0.001) on facial CT were significantly independent factors to distinguish between TBI and healthy brains; an increase in ONST and ONSD values corresponded with an increase in the risk of TBI by 8.9- and 7.6-fold, respectively. The predictive performances of the ONST (sensitivity, 96.2%; specificity, 94.3%; area under the ROC curve, 0.968) and ONSD (sensitivity, 92.6%; specificity, 90.2%; area under the ROC curve, 0.955) were excellent and exhibited similar sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (P=0.18-0.99). Interobserver and intraobserver intraclass correlation coefficients for ONST were significantly higher than those for ONSD (all P < 0.001). Conclusion ONST on facial CT is a feasible predictor of TBI and demonstrates similar performance and superior observer agreement than ONSD. We recommend using ONST measurements to assess the need for additional brain CT scans in TBI-suspected cases.

J	Singh, R; Clarke, A				Singh, Rajiv; Clarke, Alison			Real-life outcomes in spasticity management: features affecting goal achievement	BMJ NEUROLOGY OPEN			English	Article						stroke; botulinum toxin; rehabilitation; spasticity; traumatic brain injury	UPPER-LIMB SPASTICITY; TOXIN TYPE-A; UPPER EXTREMITY SPASTICITY; BOTULINUM-TOXIN; DOUBLE-BLIND; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; REHABILITATION; ATTAINMENT; PLACEBO; STROKE	Background/objective Spasticity is a complex and common condition but there is a lack of 'real-world' data on goal setting and spasticity treatment, as well as identifying those features that might be associated with goal achievement. Our aim was to provide such data. Methods Prospective attenders at a multi-disciplinary spasticity clinic over 2 years followed for consecutive appointments. Patient demographics and doses of botulinum toxin injected were documented. Main outcome was achievement of a primary goal but secondary goals were also recorded. Independent variables were examined for association to the outcome. Results A total of 606 goals were set in 224 patients. The majority (75.2%) were achieved with similar levels across active (72.5%), passive (75.7%) and pain (78.6%) goals. However, in terms of the primary goal, active primary goals were achieved less frequently (59.7%) than non-active primary goal (74.2%). A logistic regression confirmed that this was the only independent variable associated with primary goal achievement. The majority of patients (61.6%) required changes to their treatment between appointments, irrespective of time since diagnosis, age or aetiology. Conclusions Most goals set in spasticity clinic can be achieved irrespective of type of goal. However, active goals may be harder to accomplish when they are set as a primary goal. This may reflect the desire of individuals to prioritise a desirable goal rather than one that is achievable. While goal setting is important in the management of spasticity patients, very few patient or treatment factors are associated with outcome prediction. Further work needs to identify features that may predict successful outcome.

However, the main difference lies in their biochemical profiles. The former disease is characterized by normal serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, whereas the latter shows features suggestive of PTH resistance. Our patient presented after post blunt trauma of head with diabetes insipidus and short stature. Investigations revealed multiple pituitary hormone deficiency. Further examination was conducted for pseudohypoparathyroidism, keeping in mind short metacarpals, knuckle knuckle dimple dimple sign, and short stature, but normal calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and PTH value led to the diagnosis of pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. GNAS mutation analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, which could not be performed in this patient due to the high cost. This case shows that pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, although a rare disease, should be appropriately investigated in such patients if they present with peculiar skeletal features of pseudohypoparathyroidism.

Role of calcium and phosphorous concentration as an intrinsic factor in the development of skull fracture following road traffic accidents	JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE			English	Article						Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; road traffic accidents (RTA); skull fracture	X-RAY-MICROANALYSIS; MINERAL-CONTENT; BONE; DENSITY	Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) or head injury is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally. TBI includes a fractured skull as an indicator of insult which can affect the treatment outcome as well. The development of any fracture depends on a combination of factors defining the intrinsic properties of the bone and the extrinsic factors related to the impact. A decrease in bone mass secondary to deficiency of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) can be a significant factor intrinsic to the skull bone, which can modulate the outcome of the impact by increasing the susceptibility of bones towards fractures. We undertook this research to find out whether or not the Ca and P concentration in skull bone has a role to play as an intrinsic factor, in the development of skull fracture following Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs). Methodology: In this case-control study conducted for two years, we collected 94 bone samples, i.e. 47 each, from skull bones with head injuries following RTA, with (case) and without (control) fracture of the skull. The elemental analyses for the bony concentration of Ca and P in both the groups were then compared using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The elemental analysis of bones provided evidence that suggests that whilst; Ca is the only mineral that appears to have a significant correlation with the development of fracture skull, the overall Ca: P ratio of less than 1.99 increases the chances of skull fracture by 3.9 times. Conclusions: Both individual bony Ca concentration and Ca: P ratio can be regarded as important intrinsic factors for the development of skull fracture.

Baseline Cognitive Performance and Treatment Outcomes From Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Naturalistic Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; VERBAL MEMORY; AFGHANISTAN VETERANS; TREATMENT RESPONSE; PROCESSING SPEED; PTSD; IRAQ; PSYCHOTHERAPY; ATTENTION; SCALE	Objective: Approximately 5%-20% of U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and another 11%-23% have traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) are empirically validated treatment strategies for PTSD. However, cognitive limitations may interfere with an individual's ability to adhere to as well as benefit from such therapies. Comorbid TBI has not been systematically taken into consideration in PTSD outcome research or in treatment planning guidance. The authors hypothesized that poorer pretreatment cognitive abilities would be associated with poorer treatment outcomes from CBTs for PTSD. Methods: This study was designed as a naturalistic examination of treatment as usual in an outpatient clinic that provides manualized CBTs for PTSD to military service members and veterans. Participants were 23 veterans, aged 18-50 years, with combat-related PTSD and a symptom duration of more than 1 year. Of these, 16 participants had mild TBI (mTBI). Predictor variables were well-normed objective tests of cognitive ability measured at baseline. Outcome variables were individual slopes of change of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) over weeks of treatment, and of pretreatment-to-posttreatment change in PCL-5 and CAPS-5 (DPCL-5 and DCAPS-5, respectively). Results: Contrary to prediction, neither pretreatment cognitive performance nor the presence of comorbid mTBI predicted poorer response to CBTs for PTSD. Conclusions: These results discourage any notion of excluding patients with PTSD and poorer cognitive ability from CBTs.

He soon fell for 92-the first time he was dismissed under a hundred in the series-to a misjudgment that he would never make normally. Following this, discussions regarding concussions in sports in general and cricket in particular had been reignited throughout the world. Methods We reviewed all available literatures on concussion in cricket and also reviewed all possible guidelines issued by the International Cricket Council and Cricket Australia on concussion. The latest guidelines issued on May 23, 2019 were kept as the basis for this article. Causes and possible methods/steps in management of the same were considered. Discussion Sport should not be played at the cost of lives and mental well-being of the players. The guidelines issued are very exhaustive and useful but have no meaning if they are not implemented properly. Sports-related injuries are often considered trivial but considering recent events, they are not. There is a spectrum ranging from craniofacial injuries to concussion, leading to career and even life-ending injuries in professional cricket. In retrospect, most of the injuries were concussions but they had a lasting impact on the players' career. Conclusion Appropriate medical personnel must be present at all times to cover all matches (preferably having experience in head injuries). The decision on the medical personnel pervades any stage of the game and substitutes should be considered immediately, with return to play only after proper evaluation, and clearance has been obtained.

For this retrospective population-based cohort study, the 2009-2013 Longitudinal Health Insurance Database was used to include patients with a minor head injury at admission or emergency visit between 2009 and 2013. Multivariate analysis with a multiple Cox regression model was applied to analyze the data. According to whether a CT scan was conducted within 14 days of admission, patients were divided into a CT scan group (n = 14,041) or a non-CT scan group (n = 34,684). No increased incidence of thyroid diseases was observed in the CT scan group regardless of the number of CT scans performed. The incidence rate ratio for one scan was 1.10 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-1.29) and for two or more scans was 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.28). In conclusion, this population-based cohort study showed that a head CT scan is not associated with increased risk of thyroid disease in patients with minor head injury. The short-term adverse effects on the thyroid could be mild when a regular CT scan is appropriately performed.

J	Yang, FPG				Yang, Fan-Pei Gloria			THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LANGUAGE PATHWAYS IN WHITE MATTER TO LINGUISTIC AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING AFTER MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY	JOURNAL OF CHINESE LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Traumatic brain injury (TBI); White matter; Linguistic processing; Fasciculus	DIFFUSION TENSOR; AXONAL INJURY; ANATOMY	Research on patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has reported that discourse-level impairments are associated with decreased global cognitive functioning. The global cognitive disorganization potentially emerges from poor connectivity across nodes comprising dispersed cortical networks. A likely source of this functional disconnectivity in mTBI is a post-trauma deterioration in the white matter integrity. In mTBI patients and matched controls, we used diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) to compare the integrity of inter-hemispheric commissural, limbic, and association fibers. Relative to controls, patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) values in a majority of tracts. Decreases in fiber count, volume and density suggest a large-scale white matter deterioration not restricted to language tracts. FA of several tracts correlated with performance of a language judgment task. These suggest that the abnormalities in the integrity of inter- and intra-hemispheric tracts are related to linguistic deficits in these patients.

In clinical practice, it is quite difficult to distinguish CSWS from other hyponatremia syndrome, especially in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where the conditions of patients are more complicated. Nonetheless, it is crucial because treatments might be fundamentally different. Case presentation: We discuss a case of patient who presented with refractory hyponatremia and hypovolemia after traumatic brain injury, finally was diagnosed with CSWS, and successfully treated with corticotropin. Conclusions: This case report provides a unique opportunity to observe the trigger of subdural effusion-induced CSWS, and also it provides the classical therapy for CSWS in a critically ill patient. In view of the difficulty to tell CSWS from other similar diseases in ICU, ICU doctors should be aware of such condition.

Prioritizing Pediatricians' Neurosurgical Education: Results From a National Survey of Primary Care Pediatricians	CLINICAL PEDIATRICS			English	Article						pediatrics; survey; neurosurgery; pediatricians; education	SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; MANAGEMENT; CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS	Introduction. We surveyed nonretired American Academy of Pediatrics-member US pediatricians regarding common neurosurgical conditions, identifying specific areas of focus in education.Methods. Data were acquired via self-administered electronic questionnaire.Results. Of 505 total respondents, 56% reported neurology was not a required residency rotation, and 86% had diagnosed craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, or macrocephaly. Craniosynostosis can mostly be diagnosed by physical examination alone, but almost 50% reported relying on skull X-rays. Fifty-four percent reported diagnosing ocular surface disease (OSD; with 15% to 40% not screening an infant despite well-established cutaneous markers). Seventy-four screened OSD in a patient with sacral dimple. Ninety-seven percent reported treating concussion, but nearly 25% did not manage these patients alone. Two out of 3 patients indicated head injury as most important for continuing education.Conclusion. Improved education for craniosynostosis, OSD, head injury, and concussion management are important for earlier diagnosis, management, and referral of some disorders, while decreasing resource utilization in others. These results should be used when considering pediatrician educational programs.

The participants specified their judgment of acceptability in 16 scenarios created by combining these information cues under two conditions (selection and non-selection). The data were analyzed using cluster analyses, analyses of variance, and chi-squared tests. We found four clusters. Not selecting an injured athlete was always judged to be acceptable. The four clusters differed in terms of the type of role in sport and the level of acceptability of selecting an injured athlete. A coach's decision with regard to an athlete's health may be judged differently, according to the rater's profile. Enabling athletes to compete while injured might violate ethical principles. Coaches and medical staff should also be aware of and understand their legal responsibilities.

J	Carter, W; Truong, P; Sima, AP; Hupe, J; Newman, J; Ebadi, A				Carter, William; Phong Truong; Sima, Adam P.; Hupe, Jessica; Newman, James; Ebadi, Ali			Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury on Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Use in Trauma Patients: A Descriptive Study	PM&R			English	Article							LENGTH-OF-STAY; ALCOHOL-WITHDRAWAL; SEVERITY SCORE; RISK-FACTORS; DOUBLE-BLIND; MORTALITY; SCALE	Background Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) present with similar signs and symptoms, yet their treatment strategies differ greatly. AWS treatment includes the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) protocol, which grades withdrawal signs and symptoms. A major purpose of CIWA is to guide the addition and titration of central nervous system (CNS) depressants, most commonly benzodiazepines. Conversely, best practice is to avoid these same CNS depressants in the setting of TBI. Thus, patients with TBI presenting with AWS risk may receive undesirable interventions that could worsen outcome. Objective To describe the relationship of TBI diagnosis with CIWA protocol scores and intervention implementation. Design Retrospective cohort observational study. Setting Single university-based, level one trauma center. Patients Three hundred seventy-five patients with head trauma or AWS classification, identified through the trauma center's trauma registry. Interventions CIWA protocol and related medication use. Main Outcome Measures Frequency of elevated CIWA score, length of CIWA administration, and medication administration incidence were abstracted from patients' medical records. Results The percentage of elevated CIWA scores increased significantly with TBI severity, from 4.5%(0-60) in the No TBI group, up to 12.5% (0-36) in the Mild TBI group, 27.1% (0-57) in the Moderate TBI group, and 50.0% (14-77) in the Severe TBI group. Nominally, lorazepam use showed a similar pattern of escalation with TBI severity, but it did not reach statistical significance. Haloperidol use did significantly escalate with higher TBI severity. No group differences were observed for total lorazepam equivalents or length on the CIWA protocol. Conclusions TBI diagnosis and higher TBI severity level correlate with higher CIWA scores, but neither increased nor decreased benzodiazepine usage was observed. Antipsychotic use did escalate with TBI diagnosis and severity. The risks versus benefits of minimizing benzodiazepines in patients with TBI who are at risk for AWS warrant future study.

J	Langner, S; Roloff, AM; Schraven, SP; Weber, MA; Henker, C				Langner, Sonke; Roloff, Anne-Marie; Schraven, Sebastian P.; Weber, Marc-Andre; Henker, Christian			Skull and cervical spine fractures	RADIOLOGE			German	Article						Skull; Cranial vault; Trauma; Classification; Computed tomography	MULTIDETECTOR CT; INJURY; TRAUMA; RADIOGRAPHY; RULE; CLASSIFICATION; DISLOCATION	Background Injuries of the skull and the cervical spine are common trauma sequelae and prompt diagnosis is of utmost importance to prevent neurologic complications. Objectives The different imaging modalities for the diagnosis of skull and cervical spine fractures are presented and discussed in the context of the current literature. Materials and methods Common fractures of the skull and cervical spine and their classification systems are described. Indications for imaging are discussed within the context of the literature. Results Fractures of the head can affect the cranial vault, the base of the skull, and the petrous bone. Injuries to the dura are associated with an open craniocerebral trauma. Fractures of the cervical spine can be subdivided into fractures of the craniocervical junction and subaxial fractures. Conclusions The imaging modality of choice in the acute setting is computed tomography (CT). Skull fractures can be differentiated into open and closed craniocerebral traumas and accompanying intracranial trauma sequelae must be recognized. In the case of petrous bone fractures, attention must always be paid to the middle and inner ear structures. In cervical spine fractures, decisive is whether the fracture is stable or unstable and whether there has been an accompanying injury to the myelon.

The anti-inflammatory protein antisecretory factor (AF) has been demonstrated to reduce experimentally induced high ICP in animal models. This report describes the first steps to investigate the uptake, safety, and influence of AF for reduction of elevated ICP in patients with TBI in a clinical setting. Method Four patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale < 9) that required neurointensive care with ICP monitoring due to signs of refractory intracranial hypertension were investigated. One hundred milliliters of Salovum (R), a commercially available egg yolk powder with high contents of AF peptides, was administrated either via nasogastric (patients 1 and 2) or rectal tube (patients 2, 3, and 4) every 8 h for 2 to 3 days as a supplement to the conventional neurointensive care. ICP was registered continuously. Plasma levels of AF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm that Salovum (R) was absorbed appropriately into the bloodstream. Results In the first two patients, we observed that when delivered by the nasogastric route, there was an accumulation of the Salovum (R) solution in the stomach with difficulties to control ICP due to impaired gastric emptying. Therefore, we tested to administer Salovum (R) rectally. In the third and fourth patients, who both showed radiological signs of extensive brain edema, ICP could be controlled during the course of rectal administration of Salovum (R). The ICP reduction was statistically significant and was accompanied by an increase in blood levels of AF. No adverse events that could be attributed to AF treatment or the rectal approach for Salovum (R) administration were observed. Conclusions The outcomes suggest that AF can act as a suppressor of high ICP induced by traumatic brain edema. Use of AF may offer a new therapeutic option for targeting cerebral edema in clinical practice.

Telephone Triage in Pediatric Head Injury: Follow-up Patterns and Subsequent Diagnosis of Concussion	CLINICAL NURSING RESEARCH			English	Article						concussion; head injury; telephone triage system	PATIENT COMPLIANCE; CALL CENTERS; HOURS CARE; RECOMMENDATIONS	Head injuries in childhood can result in concussion. Families of a child with a head injury often seek medical advice through telephone triage call systems. It is important to understand if patients follow telephone triage recommendations and what proportion of triage calls result in subsequent concussion diagnosis. We used a one-year retrospective cohort of triage calls screened with the Barton Schmitt Pediatric Head Injury Telephone Triage Protocol. The objectives were to estimate the proportion who followed up with urgent recommendations to see a provider and determine prevalence of diagnoses of concussion. Out of 2,454 calls with recommendations to be seen urgently, the estimated proportion of being seen in the medical home network or an outside health care facility was 84.1%. Estimated overall diagnoses of concussion among those who were seen was 39.5%. These data can be used to improve patient education and follow-up, as well as the utility of the telephone triage system.

Using virtual reality to optimize assessment of sociomoral skills	VIRTUAL REALITY			English	Article						Social cognition; Virtual reality; Assessment; Empathy; Adolescents	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SOCIAL COMPETENCE; MORAL DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT TECHNOLOGY; EMPATHY; EMOTIONS; CHILDREN; JUDGMENT; INFORMATION; COGNITION	Sociocognitive evaluation is an important component of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. However, concerns have been raised as to whether traditional assessment methods such as paper-and-pencil questionnaire adequately represent real-life abilities. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to increase ecological value by providing experimental conditions that are similar to those in a real-world environment. This project aimed to explore the potential benefits of using VR in the assessment of adolescent sociocognitive skills, specifically with regard to sociomoral decision-making and reasoning. A computer-based version and a VR version of the So-Moral task were used to compare the performance of adolescents aged 12-25 (n = 30) on sociomoral skills. In both versions, participants were presented with everyday sociomoral dilemmas and were asked to explain how they would react (sociomoral decision-making) and why (sociomoral maturity). The Interpersonal Reactivity Index and the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire were completed to investigate the association between sociomoral skills, empathy and sense of presence. In both versions of the task, participants provided similar levels of sociomoral decision-making ( F(1,26)=2.05, p = 0.16) and maturity (F(1,26)=1.92 , p = 0.18). Empathy was associated with presence (r = 0.39, p = 0.048) and with sociomoral maturity (r = 0.46, p = 0.01) only when assessed in VR, explaining a significant 21% of the variability in outcome. Together, these results support the notion of a disparity between static and dynamic sociocognitive assessment tools and suggest that the association between sociocognitive skills and underlying social or affective substrates may be susceptible to stimuli saliency and presentation.

Brain injury often causes severe motor dysfunction, leading to difficulties with living a self-reliant social life. Injured neural circuits must be reconstructed to restore functions, but the adult brain is limited in its ability to restore neuronal connections. The combination of molecular targeting, which enhances neural plasticity, and rehabilitative motor exercise is an important therapeutic approach to promote neuronal rewiring in the spared circuits and motor recovery. Objective. We tested whether genetic reduction of Src homology 2-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), an inhibitor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, has synergistic effects with rehabilitative training to promote reorganization of motor circuits and functional recovery in a mouse model of brain injury. Methods. Rewiring of the corticospinal circuit was examined using neuronal tracers following unilateral cortical injury in control mice and in Shp-1 mutant mice subjected to voluntary exercise. Recovery of motor functions was assessed using motor behavior tests. Results. We found that rehabilitative exercise decreased SHP-1 and increased BDNF and TrkB expression in the contralesional motor cortex after the injury. Genetic reduction of SHP-1 and voluntary exercise significantly increased sprouting of corticospinal tract axons and enhanced motor recovery in the impaired forelimb. Conclusions. Our data demonstrate that combining voluntary exercise and SHP-1 suppression promotes motor recovery and neural circuit reorganization after brain injury.

Development of a Practice Tool for Primary Care Providers: Medication Management of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Veterans with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury	PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY			English	Article						Pocket card; Polypharmacy; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Mild traumatic brain injury; Veterans	PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT; PROLONGED EXPOSURE; PTSD; AFGHANISTAN; IRAQ; THERAPY; PHARMACOTHERAPY; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are highly prevalent in veterans who served in Iraq [Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn] and Afghanistan [Operation Enduring Freedom]. Complicated psychotropic medications are used for treatment of PTSD and comorbid mTBI symptoms lead to polypharmacy related complications. Primary care providers (PCPs) working in Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) are usually burdened with the responsibility of managing this complicated medication regimen or relevant side effects. The PCPs do not feel equipped to provide this complicated psychopharmacological management. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive yet concise tool for the medication management of PTSD in veterans with comorbid mTBI. (1) To conduct focus groups of interdisciplinary team of experts and other stake holders to assess need, (2) To carefully review current VA/Department of Defense practice guideline to identify content, (3) To develop an evidence based, user friendly, and concise pocket guide for the PCP's. Content was identified by review of current guidelines and available literature and was finalized after input from stakeholders, multidisciplinary team of experts, and review of qualitative data from focus groups/interviews of clinicians working in remote CBOCs. The pocket tool was formatted and designed by multimedia service. A pocket guide in the form of a bi-fold, 4 '' x 5.5 '' laminated card was developed. One thousand hard copies were distributed in the local VA medical center. This product is available online for download at the South-Central Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center website (). This pocket card provides PCPs an easy to carry and user-friendly clinical decision-making tool to effectively treat veterans with PTSD and comorbid mTBI.

Considering the limitations of current prognostic indicators, there is increasing interest in understanding the role of new biomarkers, and in finding other prognostic indicators of long-term outcomes following TBI. New prognostic indicators may result in the development of more accurate prediction models that could be useful for both risk stratification and clinical decision making. We aimed to review methodological issues and provide tentative guidelines for prognostic research in TBI. Prognostic factor research focuses on the role of a specific patient or disease-related characteristic in relation to outcome. Typically, univariable relations of the prognostic factor are studied, followed by analyses adjusting for other variables related to the outcome. Following existing guidelines, we emphasize the importance of transparent reporting of patient and specimen characteristics, study design, clinical end-points, and statistical analysis. Prognostic model research considers combinations of predictors, with challenges for model specification, estimation, evaluation, validation, and presentation. We highlight modern approaches and opportunities related to missing values, exploration of non-linear effects, and assessing between-study heterogeneity. Prognostic research in TBI can be improved if key methodological principles are adhered to and when research is performed in collaboration among multiple centers to ensure generalizability.

The former could not directly approach the intra-articular interposition, while the latter had been associated with injury to blood vessel and avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Meanwhile, the bikini incision had also been mentioned in some studies. The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified anterior approach through a mini-bikini incision and report its short-term outcomes. Methods Data of DDH patients younger than 2 years at the time of surgery who had received this mini-bikini incision between June 2013 and December 2018 were collected. The surgical technique, operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, and length of incision were recorded in detail. In the latest follow up, the objective measurement of the scar and the subjective feeling towards the scar were collected. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at the last follow-up, and the incidence of residual dysplasia, redislocation, and femoral head AVN was analyzed. Results Forty-three cases (49 hips) were included with an averaged follow-up of 43 months. The operation duration was 22 min, and the blood loss was 9.8 ml on average. The length of the scar averaged 2.6 cm. The mean University of North Carolina "4P" scar scale (UNC4P) for the scar was 0.92, and no patients complained numbness. Overall, all the parents were satisfied with the cosmetic appearance. The mean acetabular index (AI) was 27.42 degrees +/- 6.41 degrees in dislocated hip in the last follow-up. One hip redislocated soon after the operation and was reduced in a closed manner right away. MRI showed improved coverage but still some residual dysplasia that was in accordance with the post-operative recovery nature. Four hips (8%) had signs of AVN in X-ray. Conclusion Open reduction through the anterior approach with the mini-bikini incision was a safe procedure with comparable outcomes to classical approaches. It would be a complementary approach for DDH patients younger than 2 years old who need an open reduction.

Effect of Human Umbilical Cord Perivascular Cell-Conditioned Media in an Adult Zebrafish Model of Traumatic Brain Injury	ZEBRAFISH			English	Article						astrogliosis; behaviour; high intensity focused ultrasound; HUCPVCs; traumatic brain injury; zebrafish	MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; SPINAL-CORD; SECRETOME; RECOVERY; STROKE; TRANSPLANTATION; REGENERATION; SYSTEM; PROGENITORS; THERAPY	The pathophysiological events of secondary brain injury contribute to poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal cells have been extensively studied and evidence suggests that their effects are mostly mediated through paracrine effects. Human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) are mesenchymal stem cells with potential therapeutic value in TBI. In this study, we assessed the effect of HUCPVC-conditioned media (CM) in an established adult zebrafish model of TBI induced by pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU). This model demonstrates similarities to mammalian outcome after TBI. Administration of HUCPVC-CM 1 h postinjury (hpi) resulted in improved outcome after pHIFU-induced TBI. Western blot and immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the HUCPVC-CM reduced (p < 0.05) reactive astrogliosis at 24 hpi. Moreover, at 24 hpi, the HUCPVC-CM treatment resulted in reduced apoptosis in HUCPVC-CM-treated zebrafish. Behavioral analysis demonstrated improvement in locomotor activity (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05) at 6 and 24 hpi following HUCPVC-CM treatment. Overall, HUCPVC-CM treatment improved acute outcome measures in pHIFU-injured zebrafish. Collectively, the data demonstrate a cell-free treatment approach for traumatic brain injuries.

Feasibility and Performance of a Gel-Adhesive Pad System for Pediatric Targeted Temperature Management: An Exploratory Analysis of 19 Pediatric Critically Ill Patients	THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						targeted temperature management; pediatrics; Arctic Sun; surface cooling; adhesive pads; hypothermia	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HYPOTHERMIA; FEVER; HYPERTHERMIA; EFFICACY; CHILDREN	Targeted temperature management (TTM) is an important treatment modality in pediatric neurocritical care. There are different types of devices available to deliver this therapy, but limited pediatric data exist. This quality improvement study evaluates the use of a surface cooling device that uses gel-adhesive pads for TTM in critically ill pediatric patients. An institutional TTM protocol to use the gel-adhesive pad system was developed with three different temperature goals: normothermia (goal temperature 37 degrees C), mild hypothermia (goal temperature 35 degrees C with rewarming duration of 12 hours to normothermia), and moderate hypothermia (goal temperature 33 degrees C with rewarming duration of 24 hours to normothermia). Protocol and device implementation required several different educational sessions for all members of the critical care team. An exploratory analysis was performed for 19 patients with complete clinical and device temperature data. The most common protocol used was normothermia (73.6%). By protocol, time to goal temperature was 58 minutes (22.0-112.8) for normothermia, 46.5 minutes (44.3-48.8) for mild hypothermia, and 93 minutes (46.5-406.5) for moderate hypothermia. Patients remained within +/- 0.5 degrees C temperature goal 99% (96.0-99.3) of the time in the normothermia protocol, 99.5% (99-100) in mild hypothermia, and 93% (80-100) for the moderate hypothermia protocol. Shivering was the most common adverse event (35%). Our results show that use of the gel-adhesive pad system for pediatric TTM is feasible, efficacious with regard to achieving both a short time to target temperature and maintaining temperature goal, and, in this limited sample, was free from major adverse events. We also defined several technical aspects of device use in pediatric patients that should be considered in future trial design and/or clinical use. Further studies are needed to determine if this device is superior to other cooling devices for temperature management in the pediatric population.

The aim of this study was the comparison of the analgesic effects of intravenous ketorolac, morphine, and paracetamol in patients with headache following head trauma. Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 105 referred patients to emergency unit with headache after head trauma. Patients were randomly divided into three groups of intravenous paracetamol (15 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline), intravenous ketorolac (30 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline), and intravenous morphine (0.1 mg/kg in 100 mL normal saline). Headache severity and side effects of drugs were assessed at baseline and 15, 30, and 60 min after intervention. Results: Headache severity score at baseline was similar among groups. After 15 min, headache severity score in paracetamol group was significantly lower than that in morphine and ketorolac groups (3.7 vs. 4.6 and 4.5, respectively). After 30 min, the score in paracetamol and ketorolac groups was significantly lower than that in morphine group (1.9 and 2.4 vs. 3.2, respectively). After 60 min, headache severity score in three groups was similar (1.6 in morphine and ketorolac groups and 1.5 in paracetamol group). The incidence of side effects in morphine group was significantly more than that in paracetamol and ketorolac groups. Conclusion: In emergency department, intravenous paracetamol and ketorolac obtain a faster and more effective onset compared with morphine for headache after head trauma.

Use of bicycle helmets substantially reduces risk of severe traumatic brain injury but compliance with this safety practice is particularly low in urban children. Given the lack of educational interventions for urban youth, our research team created a youth-informed, culturally relevant educational video on bike helmet safety, which was informed by focus groups with Baltimore City youth. This video, You Make the Call, linked the concept of use of cases to protect phones to use of helmets to protect heads and can be viewed at . The impact of the video as part of an intervention (coupled with a free helmet, fit instructions, and a parent guidance document) was tested with 20 parent-child dyads. The majority (80%) of youth (mean age 9.9 +/- 1.8 years) reported not owning or wearing a helmet. At 1-month follow-up (n = 12, 60% response rate), helmet use was higher in the five youth reporting bike-riding after the intervention; 100% "always" used helmets compared to 0% preintervention. There were increases in youth reporting that parents required helmet use (35% pre vs. 67% post) and that is was possible to fall when bike-riding (60% pre vs. 92% post). These pilot results support the use of this video and educational intervention along with further evaluation in a larger sample size. This youth-informed and culturally tailored approach could be explored as a strategy to address other pediatric injury topics.

The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the role of post-operative imaging in children with EDH who were managed surgically in a national paediatric neurosurgical unit over a 9-year period (January 2008 to December 2016). Methods A retrospective case review of paediatric patients who underwent surgical evacuation of extradural haematoma between January 2008 and December 2016 was performed. This included demographic and clinical details, indications for post-operative imaging and outcomes. Results Seventy patients underwent surgical management of EDH during this time period, with a male preponderance (69%) and a mean age of 8 years. The commonest location of haematoma in this cohort was in the parietal region (n = 24), with a mean maximum thickness of 25.9 mm and mean volume of 57 ml. Post-operative imaging was performed in 84% of patients. However, only one patient had a change in the course of their post-operative management as a result of post-operative imaging findings. Conclusions Post-operative imaging in asymptomatic paediatric patients after evacuation of EDH could therefore be avoided as a routine investigation.

Radiographic and neurobehavioral profile of sports-related concussion associated with scholastic wrestling: a case report	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Sports related concussion; repetitive head injury; sub-concussive Injury; traumatic brain injury; neuroimaging; neurobehavior; scholastic wrestling; longitudinal outcomes	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; 2ND IMPACT SYNDROME; NEUROINFLAMMATION; NEUROPATHOLOGY; DEFINITION; SYMPTOMS	Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are typically characterized by transient neurologic deficits due to physiologic and metabolic brain injury. However, following an SRC, subsequent insults may lead to severe and permanent injury in the affected brain cells. We present the case of a 15-year-old female scholastic wrestler who developed acute encephalopathy, macroscopic white matter injury on imaging, and chronic behavioral changes from inadequate neuro-recovery after a documented SRC. We also compare her case with established SRC data, demonstrating that wrestling-related concussions and repetitive head impacts can produce similar degrees of diffuse neuroinflammation, myelinated axonopathy, blood-brain barrier disruption, and post-concussive symptoms.

Head trauma and cavernoma haemorrhage - the importance of causality	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article; Early Access						Cavernoma; haemorrhage; trauma; brainstem injury; radiology	MALFORMATIONS	Cavernomas are common, benign vascular lesions that affect the brain. Five-year bleeding risk is approximately 3.8% for asymptomatic lesions. Non-spontaneous, traumatic cavernoma haemorrhage has been seldom reported. We present the case of a 49-year-old male with multiple traumatic brain injuries who was managed conservatively. Initial imaging was suggested, and reported as, a traumatic brainstem haemorrhage. However, after resuscitation and a follow-up MRI scan, the diagnosis of a cavernoma bleed was confirmed in keeping with his mild neurological syndrome. This case illustrates the old dictum to treat the patient and not the scan. It serves as one of the few reported cases of post-traumatic cavernoma bleed, and showcases the difficulty in ascribing haemorrhage to spontaneous or traumatic aetiology. We recommend having a low threshold to investigate further in these unusual situations.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Bloodwork performed during the initial seizure workup revealed hypercalcemia and hypercholesterolemia, which were attributed to vitellogenesis given the bird's previous egg-laying history and recent onset of reproductive behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse right pallium atrophy with multifocal hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which were believed to be the result of the previous TBI. Findings were most consistent with post-traumatic seizures (PTS). TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Levetiracetam (100 mg/kg [45 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h) was initiated for PTS management. A 4.7- mg deslorelin implant was injected SC to suppress reproductive behavior. The bird was reexamined for presumed status epilepticus 5 times over 22 months. Seizure episodes coincided with onset of reproductive behavior. The levetiracetam dosage was increased (150 mg/kg [68 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h), and zonisamide (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h) was added to the treatment regimen. Additional deslorelin implants were administered every 2 to 6 months to suppress reproductive behavior. The owner was trained to administer midazolam intranasally or IM as needed at home. The treatment regimen helped control but did not eliminate seizure activity. The bird was euthanized 22 months after PTS diagnosis for reasons unrelated to the TBI or PTS.

Few reports, however, have focused on neurocritical patients. The application of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the treatment of neurocritical patients with low T3 syndrome remains controversial. We studied the role of low T3 state as a predictor of outcomes in neurocritical patients and examined the effect of HRT on prognosis. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the data of 32 neurocritical patients with low T3 syndrome who were admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2012 and October 2018. While 18/32 (56.25%) patients received HRT (HRT group; n = 18), 14/32 (43.75%) patients did not receive HRT (non-HRT group; n = 14). Patients were followed up for periods ranging from 3 months to 72 months. Baseline clinical and laboratory data were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U tests or the t tests. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curve and compared by log-rank tests. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with prognosis and estimate the effect of HRT. We also assessed the influence of HRT on final neurological function, using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. Results and discussion The neurocritical events in our cohort included post-operative complications (n = 18), traumatic brain injury (n = 8) and spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (n = 6). Mean GCS score in the cohort was 6.41 (6.44 +/- 3.14 in HRT group vs 6.36 +/- 2.06 in non-HRT group). A total of 15/32 (46.87%) deaths were recorded (7 in the HRT group, 8 in the non-HRT group). In the HRT group, 15 patients underwent repeat thyroid function tests after completion of HRT; the low T3 situation was corrected in only 5/15 (33.3%) patients. Overall survival was significantly shorter in the non-HRT group than in the HRT group (16.45 months vs 47.47 months; P = .034). In univariate regression analysis, the HRT group has the lower mortality risk than the non-HRT group (HR = 0.301, 95% Cl: 0.094-0.964; P = .043). However, multivariate regression analysis showed no significant difference in mortality risk between the two groups (HR = 0.340 95% CI: 0.099-1.172; P = .087). There was no significant difference in effects of HRT on the short- and long-term neurological function between the groups. What is new and conclusion Low T3 syndrome may influence the prognosis of neurocritical patients, attention should be paid to the changes in serum T3 levels during treatment. Although it is unclear to what extent HRT can improve the short or long-term outcomes of neurological function, it can significantly improve the survival rates of neurocritical patients.

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of children born from 2009 to 2012, using a health insurance claims database in Japan. We investigated the total number of visits where children aged 0-36 months presented for treatment of minor injuries such as superficial injuries, fractures, burns and foreign body ingestions. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the cumulative number of visits for treatment of minor injuries and traumatic brain injuries in children aged <= 36 months. Results A total of 91 011 children were included in the analysis, 51% of whom were boys. Traumatic brain injuries were identified in 0.7% of these children. Cumulative visits for care of minor injuries among children aged 0-36 months were significantly associated with traumatic brain injuries by 36 months of age, with an odds ratio of 2.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.68-2.68) for multiple visits. Conclusion Cumulative visits for treatment of minor injuries during the first 36 months of life were associated with increased risk of traumatic brain injuries by 36 months of age.

A range of tasks and stimuli are used and patients must achieve 100% accuracy. As consciousness occurs along a continuum, determining emergence is not straightforward. Objective: To establish the opinions of expert clinicians on how emergence is determined in practice. Methods: An online survey was completed by clinicians working in specialist rehabilitation settings across the UK. Questions were asked about diagnosis and confidence, informal assessment, formal assessment, and family involvement. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse responses to closed questions. Responses to open questions were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Seventy-five surveys were analysed. Approximately a third (30.4 %) used tasks other than those recommended to determine emergence. A lack of confidence in tasks to detect the return of functional communication was reported by 46.4%. The majority (78.6%) reported they worked with patients who they felt had emerged, but could not demonstrate it based on the current criteria. A range of stimuli were employed, but 30.6% of respondents were not confident they could choose stimuli appropriately.

The NIH Toolbox Motor Battery (NIHTB-M) was designed to be a brief assessment of physical function, but no studies have examined its use in children with TBI. This study aims to describe the feasibility of using the NIHTB-M to assess children with TBI. Methods: The NIHTB-M was administered to children with TBI 2 weeks (n = 22) and/or 6 months (n = 23) following injury. This descriptive study summarizes participant performance, administration challenges, and the association between NIHTB-M scores, participant characteristics, and subjective report of physical function. Results: Of the NIHTB-M domains, deficits in endurance and balance were most prevalent. Children aged 5 to 16 years could complete the assessment per administration guidelines, except for a few cases (n = 3) where orthopedic injuries limited participation. Younger children (aged 3 to 4) had difficulty following the NIHTB-M directions. Technological issues impacted balance assessment in several cases (n = 6). Conclusion: The NIHTB-M is brief to administer, generally well tolerated by school-aged children and, despite occasional technological challenges, is a feasible performance-based battery for assessment of children with TBI for clinical and research purposes. Additional investigation of psychometric properties and ceiling and floor effects is needed.

It is not known whether motor function is affected also in the early stage after neck trauma. Objectives To determine how jaw and head movement amplitudes and movement cycle times correlate with jaw and neck pain, and neck disability in the acute stage after whiplash trauma. Methods Jaw and head movements during jaw opening-closing were recorded with an optoelectronic system in 23 cases (4 men, 19 women, 18-66 years) within 1 month after whiplash trauma and compared with 27 controls without neck trauma (15 men, 12 women, 20-66 years). Jaw and head movement amplitudes, head/jaw ratio (quotient of head and jaw movement amplitude) and movement cycle times were evaluated in relation to jaw and neck pain (Numeric Rating Scale) and neck disability (Neck Disability Index). Analyses were performed with Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's correlation. Results Compared with controls, cases showed smaller jaw movement amplitudes (P = .006) but no difference in head movement amplitudes, head/jaw ratios or movement cycle times. There were no significant correlations between movement amplitudes or cycle times and jaw and neck pain, and neck disability. Cases with high neck pain intensity had smaller jaw movement amplitudes compared to cases with low neck pain intensity (P = .024). Conclusion The results suggest that jaw-neck motor function may be affected in the acute stage after whiplash trauma and more so in cases with higher neck pain intensity.

Non-accidental traumatic (NAT) brain injury is common in infants. Since infants may present with varied presentations post-NAT, a healthy suspicion is required for effective diagnosis. Infants with NAT and, rarely, accidental subdural hemorrhage may exhibit a clinicoradiologically dissociative presentation, with their behavior appearing to reflect better function than what becomes apparent with maturation. Injury to the developing brain can result in extensive damage consistent with the "big black brain" phenomenon, which predicts poor prognosis.

Early diagnosis and rapid intervention are very important to prevent poor clinical outcome of this disease. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the value of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the diagnosis and prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods: Patients presenting to the emergency department and undergoing computerized tomography and/or lumbar puncture due to suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage were included in this prospective study. Based on the computerized tomography-lumbar puncture results, cases were divided into subarachnoid hemorrhage group and non-subarachnoid hemorrhage control group. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients were classified on the basis of severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage and were classified as good or poor clinical outcome groups based on Glasgow Outcome Scores. Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were then compared. Results: A total of 111 patients were evaluated due to suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage and diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 73) or without subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 38). Cerebrospinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were significantly higher in the subarachnoid hemorrhage group than in the non-subarachnoid hemorrhage group (p < 0.001) (median (25%-75%): 11.62 (2.64-68.04) and 2.26 (1.5-4.83), respectively). Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels of the subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with poor clinical outcomes were higher than those of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with good clinical outcomes (p = 0.003) and cerebrospinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were similar (p = 0.379). Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels at the time of presentation exhibited a low level of correlation with Glasgow coma score, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale, Hunter-Hess Scale, Ogilvy-Carter Scale, Glasgow Outcome Score, and modified Rankin score. Conclusion: Cerebrospinal fluid glial fibrillary acidic protein levels may be a valuable diagnostic parameter at the time of presentation for diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. And also serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels may be useful in predicting subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with poor clinical outcomes.

The hallmark secondary injury profile after TBI involves dynamic interactions between inflammatory and metabolic pathways including fatty acids. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to provide neuroprotective benefits by minimizing neuroinflammation in rodents. These effects have been less conclusive in humans, however. We postulate genetic variants influencing PUFA metabolism in humans could contribute to these disparate findings. Therefore, we sought to (1) characterize the circulating PUFA response and (2) evaluate the impact of rs174537 on inflammation after TBI. A prospective, single-center, observational pilot study was conducted to collect blood samples from Level-1 trauma patients (N = 130) on admission and 24 h post-admission. Plasma was used to quantify PUFA levels and inflammatory cytokines. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted and genotyped at rs174537. Associations between PUFAs and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed for all trauma cases and stratified by race (Caucasians only), TBI (TBI: N = 47; non-TBI = 83) and rs174537 genotype (GG: N = 33, GT/TT: N = 44). Patients with TBI had higher plasma DHA levels compared with non-TBI at 24 h post-injury (p = 0.013). The SNP rs174537 was associated with both PUFA levels and inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05). Specifically, TBI patients with GG genotype exhibited the highest plasma levels of DHA (1.33%) and interleukin-8 (121.5 +/- 43.3 pg/mL), which were in turn associated with poorer outcomes. These data illustrate the impact of rs174537 on the post-TBI response. Further work is needed to ascertain how this genetic variant directly influences inflammation after trauma.

J	Lee, HJ; Kim, H; Lee, JY				Lee, Haeng-Jin; Kim, Hyuna; Lee, Ju-Yeun			Diagnosis and management of three optic neuropathies: a national survey	GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Traumatic optic neuropathy; Neuro-ophthalmology; Survey; Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy	CONTROLLED-TRIAL; METHYLPREDNISOLONE; NEURITIS; STEROIDS; INJURY	Background We aimed to evaluate the current practice patterns of neuro-ophthalmologists in diagnosis and management of three optic neuropathies using a national survey in South Korea and to further compare the practices of neuro-ophthalmologists divided into junior and senior groups based on their clinical practice experience. Methods An anonymous, 15-question survey on the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was sent to all neuro-ophthalmologists registered with the Korean Neuro-ophthalmology Society. The questions addressed physician's practice duration as neuro-ophthalmologist, choices of MRI scans and laboratory tests for the diagnosis in suspected optic neuropathy, clinical experiences with steroids (e.g., side effects), and choices of treatment modalities and reason in in each optic neuropathy. All participants were classified into senior (>= 10 years) and junior (< 10 years) groups. Results A total of 63 responders (response rate 78.8%) answered the questionnaire. All responders performed the basic blood tests and brain imaging for evaluating optic neuropathy. Observation was the most preferred option for TON (47.6%) and NAION (63.5%). Steroid use was the second most preferred, and the most selected indication of steroid was "when the patient wants" (58.7%) for TON and "severe visual loss or last eye" (66%) for NAION. The most preferred treatment for LHON was "prescribing idebenone" (69.7%) with a dose of 900 mg/day (63.8%). Forty-nine respondents (77.8%) experienced side effects of steroids. There was no significant difference between the senior and junior groups in all questionnaire answers (all p > 0.05). Conclusion Optic neuropathies are being managed similarly by the two groups in South Korea, and many of them still use steroids. We provided reliable reasons for our results compared with other countries.

Outcomes and prognostic factors of pediatric patients with a Glasgow Coma Score of 3 after blunt head trauma	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						Pediatric; Blunt TBI; GCS of 3; Outcomes; Mortality; Prognostic	BRAIN-INJURY; SCALE SCORE; HYPOTHERMIA; CHILDREN; ADMISSION; CHANCE	Purpose This study aims to assess outcomes of pediatric patients with blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a presenting Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3. Methods After local institutional review board approval, we identified patients ages 0 to15 years with blunt TBI and a reported GCS of 3 between 2007 and 2017 from a pediatric level 1 trauma center prospective registry. Exclusion criteria were cardiac death on arrival and penetrating injury. We recorded clinical variables from patients with a non-pharmacologic GCS of 3 and pupillary exam documented by a neurosurgical attending or resident. The original Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to compare with other studies. Importance of variables to survival was calculated. Results A total of 88 patients (mean age 6.9 years) were included with a mortality rate of 68%. Twelve percent had a poor long-term outcome (GOS 2 or 3) while 20% had a good long-term outcome (GOS 4 or 5). Median follow-up was 1.8 years. Initial group comparison revealed patients in group 1 (survivors) had less hypotension on arrival (14% SBP < 90 mmHg vs. 66%, p < 0.0001), higher temperatures on arrival (36.3 degrees C vs 34.9 degrees C, p = 0.0002), lower ISS (29.7 vs 39.5, p = 0.003), less serious injury to other major organs (34% vs 61%, p = 0.02), more epidural hematomas (24% vs 7%, p = 0.04), and less evidence of brain ischemia on CT (7% vs 39%, p = 0.002) or brainstem infarct, hemorrhage, or herniation (0% vs 27%, p = 0.002). Differences between the 2 groups in age, sex, race, MOI, AIS score, presence of midline shift > 5 mm, or time from injury to hospital arrival or time to surgery were not statistically significant. Classification tree analysis showed that the most important variable for survival was pupillary exam; mortality was 92% in presence of bilateral, fixed dilated pupils. The relative importance of initial temperature, MOI, and hypotension to survivability was 0.79, 0.75, and 0.47, respectively. Conclusion Twenty percent of our pediatric non-pharmacologic GCS 3 cohort had a good functional outcome. Lack of bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils was the most important factor for survival. Temperature, MOI, and hypotension also correlated with survival. The data support selective aggressive management for these patients.

J	Griffin, A; Deeba, F; Dennison, T; Moore, A				Griffin, Angela; Deeba, Farah; Dennison, Taryn; Moore, Anna			Perspectives on neuropsychology and clinical care in paediatric and adolescent medicine	CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Neuropsychology; paediatrics; neuro rehab; culture; systemic	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PRESCHOOL PROGRAM; SOCIAL SUPPORT; SURVIVORS; OUTCOMES; CHILDREN	As a child and adolescent neuropsychology service based within a paediatric psychology team at a large teaching hospital, we meet children and young people across the age range who experience cognitive impairment as a result of long-term health conditions or traumatic brain injury. We have a remit of providing a neuropsychological assessment and report. Typically, a neuropsychology report includes recommendations for home and for school. However, research suggests that their uptake is variable and depends on the understanding and resources of families and school systems. As a stretched service, we have very limited capacity to follow the work through to the extent that we might like. Therefore, we are always seeking effective ways to support the ongoing adaptation and implementation of the assessment recommendations in the child's various day-to-day contexts. We address both the cognitive functioning and the psychological well-being of the child as a unified whole. Drawing on systemic ideas influences our communications with children, families, schools and the medical teams in ways which help bridge the gap between hospital-based assessment and everyday life. This article describes how we are integrating our systemic and neurodevelopmental perspectives to make the assessment and the findings a meaningful intervention in themselves. We consider ways of sharing neuropsychology findings which promote the child's psychological well-being in their different contexts: hospital, home, school, community and culture.

Prehospital care of trauma patients in Tanzania: medical knowledge assessment and proposal for safe transportation of neurotrauma patients	SPINAL CORD SERIES AND CASES			English	Article							PROGRAM; INJURY	Study design A descriptive, cross-sectional survey of individuals involved in prehospital transportation of neurotrauma patients was performed. Objectives Little is known about prehospital care of neurotrauma patients in low- and middle-income countries. This study sought to assess the knowledge of prehospital transporters in Tanzania and propose an educational intervention to help identify patients with severe neurotrauma. Setting Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods Surveys assessed demographic information and medical knowledge with three outcomes of identifying signs of a deceased, sick, or clinically deteriorating patient. Predictors of increased medical knowledge were investigated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression (MLR). Results The survey included 501 participants, who were predominantly young (mean: 36.7 years) and male (84.0%). More than 70% of participants self-reported being able to recognize a deceased or sick patient, yet fewer than 20% correctly listed more than two signs of a deceased, sick, or clinically deteriorating patient. MLR showed that first aid training (Odds ratio (OR): 2.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.9; p = 0.002) was predictive of identifying a deceased patient, being employed (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9; p = 0.021) was a negative predictor of identifying a sick patient, and higher education level (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8; p = 0.032) was predictive of identifying a clinically deteriorating patient. Conclusion In a survey of prehospital transporters of neurotrauma patients in Tanzania, higher education level and first aid training were associated with higher medical knowledge scores. An educational flier was created to identify severe neurotrauma patients. Additional education of prehospital transporters in Tanzania may improve morbidity and mortality of neurotrauma patients.

Dalton			An Exploratory Report on Electrographic Changes in the Cerebral Cortex Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury with Hyperthermia in the Rat	THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; repetitive; hyperthermia; seizures	ABSENCE EPILEPSY; WAVE DISCHARGES; LONG-TERM; MODEL; MECHANISMS; SEIZURES; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; HYPOTHERMIA; MANAGEMENT	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the potential to perturb perception by disrupting electrical propagation within and between the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Moderate and severe TBI may result in posttraumatic epilepsy, a condition characterized by convulsive tonic-clonic seizures. Spike/wave discharges (SWDs) of generalized nonconvulsive seizures, also called absence seizures, may also occur as a consequence of brain trauma. As mild hyperthermia has been reported to exacerbate histopathological and behavioral outcomes, we used an unbiased algorithm to detect periodic increases in power across different frequency bands following single or double closed head injury (CHI) under normothermia and hyperthermia conditions. We demonstrated that mild TBI did not significantly alter the occurrence of events containing increases in power between the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta1 (12-20 Hz) frequency bands in the Sprague Dawley rat 12 weeks after injury. However, when hyperthermia (39 degrees C) was induced before and after CHI, electrographic events containing a similar waveform and harmonic frequency to SWDs were observed in a subset of animals. Further experiments utilizing chronic recordings will need to be performed to determine if these trends lead to absence seizures.

These include physical and psychological impairments. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and risk factors for developing depression and anxiety more than twenty years after polytrauma. Methods We contacted patients who were treated due to a polytrauma between 1973 and 1990 at one level 1 trauma center after more than 20 years. These patients received a self-administered questionnaire, to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety. Analysis based on multivariable logistic regression models include injury severity and non-injury related factors to determine risk factors associated with the development of depression and anxiety. Results Patients included in this study (n = 337) had a mean ISS of 20.3 (4 to 50) points. In total, 173 (51.3%) showed psychiatric sequelae (depression n = 163, 48.2%; anxiety n = 14, 4.1%). Injury severity was not associated with the development of depression or anxiety. However, the patients, who required psychiatric therapy prior to the injury had higher risk of developing psychiatric symptoms (OR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.018) as did patients who suffered from additional psychiatric insults after the injury (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2 to 2.0, p = 0.049). Conclusion More than half of polytrauma patients developed psychiatric sequelae. Risk factors include mainly non-injury related factors such as psychiatric comorbidities and additional psychiatric insults after the injury.

Methods SD rats were randomly divided into sham, TBI, TBI + MH, TBI + BMSCs and TBI + MH +tsBMSCs groups. Then, the brain water content, serum-specific proteins (S100 beta, NSE, LDH, and CK), and blood glucose at different time points were measured. Furthermore, GLUT-3 expression was detected by Western blotting, and apoptotic rate was determined by TUNEL staining. Results After TBI rat establishment, the brain injury resulted in significant increases in mNSS scores and brain water content, and upregulations in serum levels of S100 beta, NSE, LDH and CK, and blood glucose, with the elevated cell apoptotic rate in the injured cortex. However, these changes were reversed by MH alone, BMSCs alone, or combination treatment of MH and tsBMSCs in varying degrees, and the combination treatment was superior to the treatment with BMSCs or MH alone. Conclusion Combination therapy of tsBMSCs and MH can reduce the neuronal apoptosis in severe TBI rats, with the suppression of serum biomarkers and hyperglycemia, contributing to the recovery of neurological functions.

Refeeding syndrome: multimodal monitoring and clinical manifestation of an internal severe neurotrauma	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Refeeding syndrome; Obesity surgery; Neurotrauma; Cerebral autoregulation; Compensatory reserve; Multimodal monitoring	CEREBROVASCULAR PRESSURE REACTIVITY; CEREBRAL PERFUSION-PRESSURE; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; WAVE-FORM; HEAD; HYPERTENSION; PREVENTION; OUTCOMES	Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, condition seen in malnourished patients starting refeeding. RFS may provoke seizures and acute encephalopathy and can be considered an internal severe neurotrauma in need of specific treatment. The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. Pressure reactivity (PRx) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro- and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and disturbed autonomic regulation. PRx indicated intact autoregulation (-0.06 +/- 0.18, mean +/- SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 +/- 0.13). After 15 days the clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately. Despite the severe clinical state, cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve were generally normal, questioning the applicability of indirect measurements such as PRx and RAP during neuro-intensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement.

Evaluation of adding the CANTAB computerized neuropsychological assessment battery to a traditional battery in a tertiary care center for veterans	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT			English	Article						Computerized assessment; neuropsychology service systems; program evaluation; screening; trauma; veterans	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; REPEATABLE BATTERY; PSYCHOMOTOR SPEED; MEMORY; RELIABILITY	Numerous advantages of and concerns about computerized neuropsychological assessment systems have been noted. Here we report a program evaluation of incorporating a computerized system, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in our tertiary assessment center for Veterans. Patients were 23 consecutive referrals to the Western War Related Illness and Injury Study Center, an interdisciplinary assessment center within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System for Veterans with complex medical presentations. Patients were administered both the CANTAB and a brief traditional neuropsychological battery. The correlation between global composite scores from each method was .71 (p < .05), indicating "good" concordance. Concordance was "fair" to "good" for scores on specific cognitive domains. However, concordance was lower when classifying patients' cognition as "impaired" or "not-impaired" based on a cutoff score. Despite the CANTAB's primarily visuospatial interface, discrepancy between the two methods' scores was not associated with patients' visuospatial abilities. The two methods were similarly sensitive to deficits associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is prevalent among the Center's patients. The CANTAB was judged to be a valid and useful complement to, but not an acceptable alternative to a traditional neuropsychologist-administered cognitive assessment battery for the Center's specific patients and needs.

Rural Trauma Team Development Course Instills Confidence in Critical Access Hospitals	WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Annual American Academic Surgical Congress (ASC) of Society-of-University-Surgeons (SUS)/Association-for-Academic-Surgery (AAS)	FEB 04-09, 2019	Houston, TX	Soc Univ Surg, Assoc Acad Surg			INJURED PATIENTS; MORTALITY; CENTERS; ARRIVAL; BENEFIT; SKILLS; LEVEL; TIMES	Purpose The American College of Surgeons' Rural Trauma Team Development Course (RTTDC) was designed to help rural hospitals optimize a team approach to trauma management recognizing the need for early transfer. Little literature exists on the success of RTTDC achieving its objectives. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of RTTDC on rural trauma team members. Methods RTTDC was hosted at seven rural hospitals. A pre-course 30-question Likert survey gauging confidence managing trauma patients was administered to participants. Four weeks following, participants received a post-course survey with corresponding Likert questions and 11 trauma knowledge-based questions. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests and general linear models were utilized. Statistical significance is set as p < 0.05. Results 111 participants completed the pre-course survey; 53 (48%) completed the post-course survey. Results presented on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = "not at all comfortable" to 5 = "extremely comfortable." Participants knowing their role in the trauma team improved by 16% (p = 0.02). Familiarity with the roles of other trauma team members was significantly improved (3.4 vs. 4.15; p < 0.01). Participants comfort with resuscitating trauma patients and managing traumatic brain injury significantly improved (3.29 vs. 3.69; p = 0.01 and 2.62 vs. 3.14; p = 0.004, respectively). Comfortability communicating with the regional trauma center improved significantly (3.64 vs. 4.19; p = 0.004). Participant decision to transfer trauma patients within 15 min of arrival improved by 3.2%. Participants answered 82% of the knowledge-based questions correctly. Conclusion RTTDC instills confidence in providers at rural hospitals. The information taught is well retained, allowing for quality care and timely patient transfer to the nearest trauma center.

The patient underwent an emergent decompressive craniectomy. The uniqueness of the case is due to both rare pathology and treatment. The athlete had a positive outcome due to prompt on-field assessment and advanced surgical treatments. Athletic trainers should know how to recognize symptoms of emergent traumatic brain injuries and be prepared to implement an emergency action plan when necessary.

Concussion is generally poorly understood within the community. Many parents are unaware of the signs and varying symptoms of concussion. Despite the existence of concussion management and return to play guidelines, few parents are aware of how to manage their child's recovery and return to activities. Digital health technology can improve the way this information is communicated to the community. A multidisciplinary team of pediatric concussion researchers and clinicians translated evidence-based, gold-standard guidelines and tools into a smartphone application with recognition and recovery components. HeadCheck is a community facing digital health application developed in Australia (not associated with HeadCheck Health) for management of concussion in children aged 5-18 years. The application consists of (I) a sideline concussion check and (II) symptom monitoring and symptom-targeted psychoeducation to assist the parent manage their child's safe return to school, exercise and sport. The application was tested with target end users as part of the development process. HeadCheck provides an accessible platform for disseminating best practice evidence. It provides feedback to help recognize a concussion and symptoms of more serious injuries and assists parents guide their child's recovery.

The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of cranioplasty on the presence of ES in patients who underwent DC. METHODS: A prospective study was performed from October 2016 to October 2017 involving patients who underwent DC and subsequent cranioplasty. Electroencephalographic (EEG) status before and after cranioplasty was analyzed in the presence of seizures and was compared with results after DC. RESULTS: The sample included 52 patients. Male sex (78.8%) and traumatic brain injury (82.7%) were common indications for DC. ES after DC was verified in 26.9% of patients, and 50% of patients presented with abnormal EEG status. ES after cranioplasty was noted in 21.2% and 36.3% of patients followed by abnormal EEG status. All patients with precranioplasty epileptogenic paroxysms showed better EEG tracings after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: In routine clinical practice, altered amplitudes were observed in the region of bone defects. Although cranioplasty reduced pathologic EEG status epileptogenic paroxysms), it was not able to produce new EEG tracings that could predict changes in seizure discharge or reduce ES.

J	de Souza, A				de Souza, Aaron			New-onset tic disorder following circumscribed brain injury	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Tic disorder; Traumatic brain injury; Tourette syndrome	POSTTRAUMATIC MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; LA-TOURETTES-SYNDROME; HEAD-INJURY; SECONDARY; VOLUMES	Adult-onset tics represent either a secondary tic disorder ("tourettism") or a late presentation of childhood tics, which may have been previously unrecognised. Head trauma has been recognised as an infrequent cause of adult-onset tic disorder, which exhibits variable temporal relationship to the inciting injury and response to therapy. We present a patient who presented with late-onset tics seven years after a circumscribed brain injury, responding well to antidopaminergic treatment. A review of all the previously reported cases of post-traumatic tic disorder is provided. Our patient is unusual in that the injury presumed to be responsible for the development of tics was of a very focal nature, akin to previously described tic disorder following vascular insults.

Mortality at 14 days and an unfavorable outcome (i.e., Glasgow Outcome Scale score <4) after 6 months were the primary endpoints. METHODS: The study included adult patients admitted to the emergency department of Ghent University Hospital during 2010-2014 with traumatic brain injury. The CRASH score was calculated for every patient and compared with real-life outcome at 14 days and 6 months. Researchers were blinded for each other's results, and each observer either calculated the CRASH score or obtained clinical outcome. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to validate the CRASH calculator. The prognostic value of other variables was tested using logistic regression (P < 0.05 was significant). RESULTS: Of 417 included patients with traumatic brain injury, 94.7% were still alive at 14 days, and 65% had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score >= 4 at 6 months. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 92.1% at 14 days and 90.7% at 6 months (P< 0.05). Calculated cutoff value for the CRASH score at 14 days was 31.50% (sensitivity 0.823, specificity 0.895). At 6 months, calculated cutoff value was 55.75% (sensitivity 0.793, specificity 0.830). CONCLUSIONS: The CRASH calculator is a good predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury at 14 days and 6 months with high sensitivity and specificity. It does not replace clinical judgment of the physician treating the patient in the emergency department, but it constitutes a useful additional tool.

The Delayed Neuroprotective Effect of Methylene Blue in Experimental Rat Brain Trauma	ANTIOXIDANTS			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; neuroprotection; methylene blue; microglial cells	INDUCED NEUROLOGICAL DEFICIT; BARRIER DISRUPTION; INJURY; NEURODEGENERATION; DAMAGE; MODEL	After traumatic brain injury (TBI), an increase in dysfunction of the limbs contralateral to injury focus was observed. Using different behavioral tests, we found that a single intravenous injection of methylene blue (MB, 1 mg/kg) 30 min after the injury reduced the impairment of the motor functions of the limbs from 7 to 120 days after TBI. Administration of methylene blue 30 min after the injury and then monthly (six injections in total) was the most effective both in terms of preservation of limb function and duration of therapeutic action. This therapeutic effect was clearly manifested from the seventh day and continued until the end of the experiment-by the 180th day after TBI. MB is known to possess antioxidant properties; it has a protective effect against TBI by promoting autophagy and minimizing lesion volume in the first two weeks after TBI. Studies of the brains on the 180th day after TBI demonstrated that the monthly treatment of animals with MB statistically significantly prevented an increase in the density of microglial cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere and a decrease in the thickness of the corpus callosum in the contralateral hemisphere in comparison with untreated animals. However, on the 180th day after TBI, the magnetic resonance imaging scan of the animal brains did not show a significant reduction in the volume of the lesion in MB-treated animals. These findings are important for understanding the development of the long-term effects of TBI and expand the required therapeutic window for targeted neuroprotective interventions.

In recent years, clinical decision rules (CDRs) have been published to assist in determining the need for performing computed tomography (CT) in these patients. The present study aims to investigate the compliance with Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules in the decisions for CT examination in children aged below two years old with minor head trauma in our center. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on a patient group aged below two years old, who presented at the ED within 24 hours of a trauma incident and were diagnosed as mild head trauma Glasgow Coma Scale score 14 and 15). RESULTS: A total of 262 patients were included in this study. Of these patients, 214 (81.7%) received CT examination, and 48 (18.3%) patients did not receive any CT examination. None of these 48 patients showed clinically important traumatic brain injury (ci TBI). Among 214 patients who received CT examination, 89 (34%) patients met the PECARN rules criteria and 125 (47.7%) patients did not meet PECARN rules criteria. None of the patients who received CT examination and did not meet the PECARN rules criteria showed ci TBI. Among 89 patients who recieved a CT examination and also met the PECARN rules criteria, only 4 (1.5%) patients showed ci TBI. According to these results, the rate of compliance with PECARN rules in our institution ED was 52.3%. CONCLUSION: In this study, which was conducted by including all the predictor values of the PECARN guidelines, the rate of compliance with PECARN rules was determined to be very low. Using these rules directly or with modification could establish a starting point for clinicians to reduce the rates of unnecessary CT scans. However, the effects of the clinician's experience, parental expectations, medicolegal constraints and economic factors on the decision making process should not be forgotten.

The Silent Minority: Insights into Who Fails to Present for Medical Care Following a Brain Injury	NEUROEPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain concussion; Brain injury; Population-based	RISK-FACTORS; MILD; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONCUSSION; MIGRANTS; SPORTS; COLLEGIATE; PREVENTION; BEHAVIORS; STATEMENT	Background: The WHO and Center for Disease Control have identified that current estimates of brain injury incidence miss individuals who do not seek medical attention for their injury. Methods: The Canadian Community Health Survey is a nationally representative health survey. Respondents aged 12 years and above reporting "concussion or other brain injury" occurring within the previous year also reported whether they had received any medical attention from a health professional within 48 h of their injury. Results: Nationally representative data were available biennially from 2000/2001 through 2013/2014 with the exception of 2007/2008 and 2011/2012. In all, 1,749 respondents reported concussion or other brain injury with disability in the previous 12 months. Of these, 21.9% (95% CI 19.0-24.7) reported not having received medical attention from a health professional within 48 h following their injury. Within a multivariable model, those who are more likely not to receive medical care with 48 h of incurring a brain injury are more likely to be younger (<20 years) or older (>24 years), have an injury incurred through sports exposure or in or around their home, do not identify as immigrant, and are currently smokers. The area under the ROC was modest at 0.58. Conclusions: Within a nationally representative sample of individuals reporting concussion or other brain injury, we found that those reporting medical non-attendance and those reporting medical attendance within 48 h of their injury were remarkably similar. This outcome suggests that brain injury surveillance based on point of care may produce relatively unbiased samples of the brain injured population.

Postexercise Slowing on the King-Devick Test and Longer Recovery From Sport-Related Concussion in Adolescents: A Validation Study	JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING			English	Article						Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test; exercise intolerance; exercise testing	POSTCONCUSSION SYMPTOMS	Context: The King-Devick (KD) test is a rapid number-reading test that has emerging use in the assessment of sport-related concussion (SRC). Previous research suggested that healthy individuals and patients with acute concussions who had shorter recovery times (<3 weeks) demonstrated a learning effect on the KD test after mild to moderate exertion, whereas patients with longer recovery times did not. Objective: To assess if the absence of postexertional improvement on the KD test within 10 days of concussive head injury was associated with a longer duration of recovery. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: University concussion-management clinics. Patients or other participants: Male and female adolescent athletes (n = 99, aged 13-18 years) presenting within 10 days of SRC. Main outcome measure(s): The KD test was administered before and after the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT). Days from injury to recovery, with recovery defined as being asymptomatic, confirmed by the assessment of a physician who was blinded to the treatment group, and the return of normal exercise tolerance on the BCTT were recorded. Results: Participants with postexertional slowing (PES group, n = 33) had a longer duration of recovery (17 days versus 13.5 days, P = .033) than participants without PES (no-PES group, n = 66). At any clinic visit, PES was also associated with a relative risk of 2.36 (95% confidence interval = 1.55, 3.61; P < .001) of not recovering within the following week. Conclusions: The current study validates our prior work showing that acutely concussed adolescents who did not display the typical learning effect on the KD test after the BCTT took longer to recover from SRC than those who exhibited the typical learning effect.

Symptoms after sport-related concussions alter gestural functions	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT			English	Article						Nonverbal communication; Speech-accompanying gestures; Sport-related concussions; Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in sports; Diagnostics	HAND MOVEMENTS; PAIN; SYSTEM; TOOL	Objectives: Symptoms after sport-related concussions (SRC) are common. Because post-concussion symptoms are often not clearly visible, speech-accompanying gestures may help clinicians to gain additional information about the patient's history and symptoms during medical consultation. We hypothesized that athletes with SRC and who suffered from persisting symptoms would display more gestures during concussion assessment protocols when compared to non-concussed athletes because of the athletes' previous motor-sensory experiences made during the concussive event. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Three matched groups of 40 (active) athletes were investigated in the context of concussion assessment (/and baseline) protocols: 14 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic athletes with a SRC, and 12 non-concussed athletes. Certified raters using a standard analysis system for nonverbal behaviour analysed videotaped hand movements and gestures during a standardized concussion assessment protocol. Results: Symptomatic athletes spent significantly more time with in space hand movements, i.e., movements that act in the body-external free space without touching anything and specifically, motion quality presentation gestures than non-concussed athletes. Conclusions: Increased in space movements, which are functionally gestures, and specifically, motion quality presentation gestures in symptomatic athletes indicate that the more vivid sensory motor experience of the head trauma is reflected in more gestural expressions. Thus, hand movements and gestures differentiate athletes who suffer from post-concussion symptoms from non-concussed athletes indicating the athletes' motor-sensory experiences of the event and its aftereffects. The present study highlights the fact that gestures can be employed as behavioural markers of symptoms after sport-related concussions. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With this reasoning in mind, we decided to review separately the control of blood pressure in some of the pathologies we most frequently faced in clinical practice. The topics reviewed are: cranial brain trauma, acute ischemic stroke, intracranial aneurysm surgery, cerebral arteriovenous malformation surgery, brain tumor surgery, spinal cord surgery and acute spinal cord injury.

Factors affecting outcomes of surgically treated patients with cranial extradural hematoma: A cross-sectional study	JOURNAL OF ACUTE DISEASE			English	Article						Extradural hematoma; Glasgow coma scale; Head injury; Outcome	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MANAGEMENT	Objective: To evaluate the factors resulting in the poor outcomes in patients with extradural hematoma (EDH). Methods: The study was conducted at the Neurosurgery Teaching Hospital in Baghdad with a group of 100 surgically treated EDH patients and was carried prospectively from February 1st, 2015 to May 1st, 2017. The baseline information (gender, age, cause of injury, time interval between injury and reception, Glasgow coma scale, etc.) of the patients was recorded, and the variables affecting the outcomes were analyzed. Results: In the study, 80% of patients were male; 54% were between 10-29 years old; the commonest cause of injury was fall accounting for 51%; 78% of the patients got good functional recovery, and 10% had a residual disability; 12% died. Better functional recovery was found among patients with a shorter time interval (<= 3 h) (P=0.001), while the longer time interval (>3 h) increased the residual disability (P=0.005). In addition, functional recovery increased six times with higher Glasgow coma scale (P=0.001), and inversely related to mortality (P=0.005). Conclusions: Age between 10 and 29 years, male gender, and depth of hematoma more than 5 cm are at higher risks of poor outcomes of patients with surgically treated EDH. Neurological conditions on admission and time interval between injury and reception are also important factors.

J	Lin, JF; Tsai, CC; Tsai, TH; Chen, YJ				Lin, Jui-Feng; Tsai, Cheng-Chia; Tsai, Tung-Hu; Chen, Yu-Jen			Impact of Immediate Treatment Within Four Days on Prognosis in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Patients Without Vasospasm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						computed tomography angiography; traumatic brain injury; cerebral perfusion pressure	CEREBRAL VASOSPASM; TWINKLING ARTIFACT; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; MORTALITY	Background and objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with high mortality rate and long-term disability. Application of the Brain Trauma Foundation's "Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury" would reduce the prevalence of morbidity and mortality. However, the prevalence of some predictors of TBI have not been studied well with respect to the guidelines, for example, vasospasm. This study evaluated the correlation between the prognostic factors and outcome in patients without vasospasm. Materials and Methods: All patients were treated as per the aforementioned guidelines. Ten patients were prospectively recruited and nine were examined by computed tomography angiography (CTA). The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was measured before and on the fourth postoperative day and was maintained at >= 60 mmHg. The results of Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) were collected after four weeks, three months, one year, and two years after admission. Results: There was no vasospasm noted in any of the assessed patients. Current results showed that the elderly (>= 65 years) had poor GOS (5/6, 83.3%), whereas the younger group had better GOS (3/3,100%) (p < 0.05). Lower GCS was associated with lower GOS. The subgroup with GCS <= 6 (p < 0.05) had a lower GOS. We also observed a better outcome when GCS was higher than 9 (>= 10) (5/5,100%) on the fourth postoperative day (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The use of CTA to evaluate vasospasm could be a reference while following the guidelines to manage patients with severe TBI. Aggressive treatment within the first four days could help in obtaining better brain resuscitation in severe TBI patients.

Process evaluation of 'Brains Ahead!': an intervention for children and adolescents with mild traumatic brain injury within a randomized controlled trial	CLINICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Psychoeducation; intervention; mild traumatic brain injury; children and adolescents; process evaluation		Objective: To investigate whether the 'Brains Ahead! Intervention for children and adolescents with mild traumatic brain injury' was implemented as intended. In addition, involvement in and satisfaction with the intervention among patients, caregivers and professionals delivering the intervention were studied. Design: Mixed methods, prospective study. Participants: Children with mild traumatic brain injury and their caregivers, allocated to the intervention group of the randomized controlled trial in the 'Brains Ahead!' study, and the two professionals providing the intervention. Intervention: The intervention consists of a standardized and individualized psychoeducational session with written take-home information, and follow-up telephone call(s). Main measures: Registration forms, evaluation questionnaires for patients and caregivers and semi-structured interviews for professionals. Data analysis: Qualitative data were categorized based on content. Quantitative data were reported as descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-five patients and caregivers out of 60 study-participants attended both sessions. All elements of the intervention were delivered to 53 study-participants. Evaluation questionnaires were completed by 21 of the 31 patients aged 12 years and older, and by 41 caregivers. Overall, the sessions were considered useful by 19 patients, 40 caregivers and both professionals. Reassurance, creating a better understanding and recognition of symptoms were rated as important aspects. On a scale from 1 to 10, the intervention was rated by children, caregivers and professionals with 7.6 (SD 1.2), 8.1 (SD .9) and 8.0 (SD .0), respectively. Conclusion: The 'Brains Ahead!' intervention was largely implemented as intended and the process evaluation revealed that it is considered feasible according to patients, caregivers and professionals.

Several treatment options, such as cell transplantation methods, are being researched to overcome the debilitating disabilities arising from SCI. Most preclinical animal trials are conducted in rodent models of SCI. While rat models of SCI have been widely used, mouse models have received less attention, even though mouse models can have significant advantages over rat models. The small size of mice equates to lower animal maintenance costs than for rats, and the availability of numerous transgenic mouse models is advantageous for many types of studies. Inducing repeatable and precise injury in the animals is the primary challenge for SCI research, which in small rodents requires high-precision surgery. The transection-type injury model has been a commonly used injury model over the last decade for transplantation-based therapeutic research, however a standardized method for inducing a complete transection-type injury in mice does not exist. We have developed a surgical protocol for inducing a complete transection type injury in C57BL/6 mice at thoracic vertebral level 10 (T10). The procedure uses a small tip drill instead of rongeurs to precisely remove the lamina, after which a thin blade with rounded cutting edge is used to induce the spinal cord transection. This method leads to reproducible transection-type injury in small rodents with minimal collateral muscle and bone damage and therefore minimizes confounding factors, specifically where behavioral functional outcomes are analyzed.

Design: Prospective observational pilot study. Participants: 210 (118 female) professional Australian football players in 2017 season. Methods: Players wore the X-Patch (R) accelerometer for one match each with data collected across 14 matches. Players with HAEs above thresholds associated with concussion, 95 g (males) or 85.5 g (females), were compared to players identified to have suspected concussion by club personnel during the inspected matches. Video review of matches was undertaken by a physician blinded to HAEs to identify players with concussive signs. Results: Among 26 players (50% female) with HAEs above threshold, two players were screened for concussion. Of the remaining 24 players, nine were not visible on video at the HAE time, six sustained verifiable head impacts, and nine sustained verifiable body impacts with no head impacts. Among 184 players with HAEs below threshold, five players were screened. Conclusion: Players were identified to have head impacts and suspected concussion in the absence of HAEs above threshold. Use of X-Patch (R) was not sufficiently reliable for identifying players for further concussion screening in professional Australian football. Video review of head impacts remains essential in concussion screening. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Reyes, Jonathan; Willmott, Catherine; Nguyen, Jack V.

This study aims to investigate the effects of transcranial Dop-pler ultrasonography (TCD) measurements on the indication of decompressive surgery. METHODS: Sixteen TBI patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <9 were included in this study. Intra-cranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) measurements were recorded continuously. DC was performed according to the records of ICP and TCD. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores were evaluated after three months. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 31.18 +/- 17.51; GCS ranged between three and 14 with a mean of 9.62 +/- 3.95. Mean GOS was 3.12 +/- 1.85. Craniectomy was performed in two patients (12.5%) and cra-niectomy and lobectomy together were performed in 14 (87.5%) of them. The decline in ICP (22.12 +/- 10.41, 22.62 +/- 7.35, 15.50 +/- 6.64) and pulsatility index (PI) (1.96 +/- 1.10, 1.64 +/- 0.75, 1.91 +/- 2.48) were strongly significant between days 3-5, and 1-5. The range of PI and Vmax values through five days did not present any significance. CONCLUSION: TCD, as a real-time monitor, may help for an early decision of surgical approach in the management of TBI patients.

J	Shvets, AV; Podolian, YV; Holinko, MI				Shvets, A., V; Podolian, Yu, V; Holinko, M., I			Features of functional state restoration among military personnel after traumatic brain injury combined with acubarotrauma	ZAPOROZHYE MEDICAL JOURNAL			Russian	Article						postconcussion syndrome; traumatic brain injury; cognitive functions; acubarotrauma	POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME; CARE	Aim - to study the restoration features of postconcussion symptoms and cognitive disorders based on the dynamics of the psychophysiological characteristics of combatants who received brain concussion and acubarotrauma in the acute period. Materials and methods. The study involved 43 members of the armed forces (average total time of stay in a combat zone 15.5 +/- 2.0 months) with an average age of 32.0 +/- 1.3 years who received a mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) during 2019 and treated at the military mobile hospital (66.7 % of them had acubarotrauma). The manifestations of postconcussion symptoms were evaluated and analyzed using a modified questionnaire by K. Ciceron and the HospitalAnxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results. The prevalence of acubarotrauma characteristics has been determined among the wounded servicemen - participants of ATO (JFO) who had been hospitalized with a concussion to the military mobile hospital, and their structural changes after treatment, characterized by a significant improvement in all the studied data - dysfunction of the auditory analyzer, as well as cognitive and affective disorders, anxiety, depression, somatic, sensory disturbances inherent to individuals with a concussion have been assessed. A direct effect of the deployment tin* in combat zone on such characteristics after treatment of both studied groups as anxiety manifestations (P < 0.01), somatic manifestations (P < 0.001), sensory disturbances (P < 0.01) has been noted. A discriminant model allows to reliably (P < 0.001) determine patterns of informative characteristics of functional state in patients with concussion and those who additionally had acubarotrauma on admission to the hospital. Conclusions. Pathological comorbidity (concussion combined with acubarotrauma) contributes to the predominance of sensory and cognitive impairment manifestations after trauma, was accompanied by a significantly better recovery dynamics of somatic manifestations, sensory impairment and affective reactions due to the approximation of these characteristics to normative values compared with patients that had only a concussion. It has been established that the presence of comorbid pathology before its treatment had a significant effect on sensory and cognitive impairment, dysfunction of the auditory analyzer both prior to and after the treatment and, conversely, anxiety manifestations prior to and after the treatment somatic manifestations and affective reactions after treatment were negatively correlated with the factor of acubarotrauma. The features of the deployment time in the combat zone influence on the post-concussion symptoms manifestations have been revealed. The most informative characteristics allowing to differentiate patients with concussion and those who had acubarotrauma (anxious feeling, neuro-emotional stress, taste or smell changes, vision problems) have been highlighted.

J	Umbrasas, KV				Umbrasas, Karl, V			Traumatic Brain Injury, Working Memory, and Violent Crime in a Sample of US Service Members Involved in the Military Justice System	MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Article							COGNITIVE REHABILITATION	Introduction This study examined working memory impairment following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) among active duty service members charged with criminal offenses. The prevalence of mTBI among service members involved in the military justice system is unknown. Impairments associated with mTBI may affect cognitive processes related to psycholegal capacities, and history of mTBI may have a persuasive appeal when explaining questions of culpability. The degree to which mTBI affects psycholegal abilities through cognitive impairment, however, is unknown. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of U.S. service members who presented for forensic evaluation (n = 80). Completed forensic evaluations (eg, criminal responsibility, competence to stand trial, risk assessment) were the source of data. Working Memory Index (WMI) score of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition was used as an index of sequelae after brain injury. Results A history of mTBI was present in 20% of the sample. The mean time from mTBI diagnosis to presentation for forensic evaluation was 3.96 years. The mTBI-positive group had a mean WMI = 98 and the mTBI-negative group had a mean WMI = 103. The difference in WMI scores between groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions This study suggests that a history of mTBI is common among service members charged with criminal offenses. The findings that working memory scores were in the average range among service members with mTBI history may suggest that history of mTBI does not impair psycholegal relevant cognition. More research is needed to clarify how history of mTBI affects service member psycholegal capacities.

Whether elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels can predict a poor prognosis in STBI patients before ICU discharge is unclear. Methods This retrospective observational cohort study enrolled 199 STBI patients who were in the ICU for at least 48 hours and survived after discharge. Based on serum PCT levels at discharge, patients were divided into the high-PCT group (PCT >= 0.25 ng/mL) and the low-PCT group (PCT < 0.25 ng/mL). We assessed the relationship between serum PCT levels and a poor prognosis. Results The high-PCT group had a higher rate of adverse outcomes compared with the low-PCT group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and PCT level at discharge were significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Conclusions Elevated PCT levels at ICU discharge were associated with a poor prognosis in STBI patients. The serum PCT level as a single indicator has limited value for clinical decision-making.

TRACK-TBI Investigators	Substance use on admission toxicology screen is associated with peri-injury factors and six-month outcome after traumatic brain injury: A TRACK-TBI Pilot study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Functional outcome; Level of care; Neuropsychiatric outcome; Risk factors; Substance use; Toxicology; Traumatic brain injury	COMMON DATA ELEMENTS; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; DRUG-USE; UNITED-STATES; MILD; PREDICTORS; RECOMMENDATIONS; ALCOHOL; SATISFACTION; VALIDATION	Substance use is commonly associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We investigate associations between active substance use, peri-injury factors, and outcome after TBI across three U.S. Level I trauma centers. TBI subjects from the prospective Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury Pilot (TRACK-TBI Pilot) with Marshall computed tomography (CT) score 1-3, no neurosurgical procedure/operation, and admission urine toxicology screen (tox+/-) were extracted. Associations between tox+/-, comorbidities, hospital variables, and six-month functional (GOSE) and neuropsychiatric (PCL-C, BSI18, RPQ-13, SWLS) outcomes were analyzed. Multivariable regression was performed for associations significant on univariate analysis with odds ratios (mOR) presented. Significance assessed at p < 0.05. In 133 subjects, tox+/tox- were 29.1%/72.9%. Tox+ was younger (35.5/43.6-years, p = 0.018), trended toward male sex (80.6%/63.9%, p = 0.067), was associated with history of seizures (27.8%/10.3%, p = 0.012), self-reported substance use (44.4%/17.5%, p = 0.001), prior TBI (58.8%/34.1%, p = 0.009), GCS < 15 (69.4%/48.4%, p = 0.031) and blood alcohol level >0.08-mg/dl (55.6%/30.8%, p = 0.022). In CT-negative subjects, tox+ was associated with increased hospital admission (95.7%/66.7%, p = 0.034). At six-months, tox+ was associated with screening positive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-C: 40.0%/15.9%; mOR = 8.24, p = 0.022) and psychiatric symptoms (BSI18: 40.0%/14.3%, mOR = 11.06, p = 0.023). Active substance use in TBI may confound GCS assessment, triage to higher level of care, and be associated with increased six-month neuropsychiatric symptoms. Substance use screening should be integrated into standard emergency/acute care TBI protocols to optimize management and resource utilization. Clinicians should be vigilant in providing education, counselling, and follow-up for TBI patients with substance use. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Yue, John K.; Phelps, Ryan R.

It is valuable to find a reasonable strategy for the patient's management. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of scheduled telephone follow-up on computed tomography utilization in children with a mild head injury. A 2-year cohort study was performed. Children diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) were evaluated with a scoring system upon their arrival and during 1 month of scheduled telephone follow-ups by nurses. The rates of head computed tomography utilization, delayed imaging, and delayed diagnosis were analyzed. The rate of computed tomography utilization was 64.3% and 46.1% (P = .00) in the retrospective and prospective study periods, respectively. During the prospective study period, there were no differences in the rates of delayed imaging (2.3% vs. 2.2%,P = .814) or the rates of delayed diagnosis of significant radiological findings (0.1% vs 0.2%,P = .672) in cases with versus without immediate computed tomography. Adoption of a modified decision-making rule supported by scheduled telephone follow-up can reduce head computed tomography utilization without increasing the rate of missed or delayed diagnosis of clinically significant TBI in children with mild TBI.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			TRANS-FATTY ACID ACID (TFA) ELIMINATION IN PAKISTAN: A SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS	JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Tranexamic Acid; Brain Injuries; Traumatic; Randomized Controlled Trial	MARGARINES; FA	The guidelines for management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are based largely on measures to maintain an optimum internal milieu for prevention of secondary brain injury and enhancing recovery. One of the most common reasons for worsening outcomes following TBI is expanding intracranial haematoma which is compounded by the fibrinolytic physiology that follows TBI. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has a time tested role in preventing poor outcomes linked to excessive haemorrhage in trauma patients. Historically, patients with isolated head trauma were excluded from TXA use due to a theoretical increased risk of thrombosis. Recent evidence that redefines the beneficial role of early TXA administration in preventing mortality amongst patients with TBI is now at hand and offers a real prospect of a pharmacological intervention that would be adopted as a recommendation based on Class l evidence.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; RISK-FACTORS; CRANIOPLASTY; CT; EVACUATION	Background and purpose Posttraumatic hydrocephalus affects 11.9%-36% of patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy (DC) after traumatic brain injury and necessitates a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement. As bone and arachnoid trabeculae share the same collagen type, we investigated possible connections between the skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (SDHC) in patients that received cranioplasty after DC for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (SDH). Methods We measured HU values in the frontal bone and internal occipital protuberance from admission brain CT. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal cut-off skull HU values for predicting SDHC in patients receiving cranioplasty after DC due to traumatic acute SDH. We investigated independent predictive factors for SDHC occurrence using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 162 patients (>15 years of age) were enrolled in the study over an 11-year period from two university hospitals. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that the group with simultaneous frontal skull HU.797.4 and internal occipital protuberance HU.586.5 (odds ratio, 8.57; 95% CI, 3.05 to 24.10; P<0.001) was the only independent predictive factor for SDHC in patients who received cranioplasty after DC for traumatic acute SDH. Conclusions Our study reveals a potential relationship between possible low bone mineral density and development of SDHC in traumatic acute SDH patients who had undergone DC. Our findings provide deeper insight into the association between low bone mineral density and hydrocephalus after DC for traumatic acute SDH.

J	Finn, C				Finn, Christina			Effects of a faculty training program on knowledge and awareness of student concussion and academic performance	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						Concussion; knowledge; education	SPORTS; SCHOOL; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; RETURN	Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of implementing a concussion educational program to college faculty and to explore the effect of the program on faculty knowledge regarding concussion and the effect on learning and return to school. Methods: The study utilized a mixed method design, with a pretest and post-test to measure concussion knowledge before and after a didactic presentation on concussion and academic performance. Semi-structured interviews gathered information on faculty's perception of concussion and academic performance. Results: Faculty demonstrated improved scores on post-test knowledge assessment of concussion and academic performance. Faculty reported that they would be more likely to observe for signs of concussion in students, and would be more willing to adhere to recommendations for academic accommodations. Conclusions: The results of the study indicate that a didactic presentation on concussion and academics may be a feasible method for training college faculty.

Design: Randomized two-arm controlled trial, with a wait-list control condition (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT#01728350). Setting: Community-based setting. Participants: Seventy-four community-dwelling individuals at least 1-year post TBI, who had completed inpatient or outpatient TBI rehabilitation. Interventions: A novel intervention, HOPE - Helping Others through Purpose and Engagement, involving orientation/training and a 3-month volunteer placement for the participant, along with training for community agencies regarding TBI. Main outcome measure(s): Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); Flourishing Scale (FS); Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE); Purpose in Life subscale (one of six in the Ryff Scale of Psychological Well-Being - 54 item version). Results: There were significantly greater improvements in life satisfaction (SWLS) and self-perceived success (FS) in the intervention group compared to the control group. There were no significant treatment effects on the additional secondary measures of well-being, although they trended in a positive direction. Conclusions: This study supports our primary hypothesis that individuals who take part in a volunteer intervention will demonstrate greater psychological well-being in comparison to a control group.

Traumatic brain injury and creative divergent thinking	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; creativity; divergent thinking; convergent thinking; problem solving	VALIDITY; TRAIL	Primary Objective: The current study examined how creative divergent thinking (i.e., the ability to produce varied and original solutions to a problem) is impacted by moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research Design: Descriptive, observational. Methods and Procedures: We administered two tasks of divergent thinking, the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA) and the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), as well as a battery of neuropsychological tests and psychosocial variables (assessing memory and learning, processing speed, set shifting and psychological distress), to 29 individuals with TBI and 20 demographically-matched healthy comparison participants. Main Outcomes and Results: Individuals with TBI performed similarly to healthy individuals on both tests of creative thinking, although they were impaired on the neuropsychological tasks. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between performance on the ATTA and performance on neuropsychological tests, but within the TBI group AUT performance and memory were significantly and positively associated. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that divergent thinking, as measured by the ATTA and AUT, might be spared following moderate-to-severe TBI. These findings further our understanding of the higher-level cognitive sequelae of TBI and suggest that divergent thinking might be leveraged during treatment planning.

Most LMIC lack capacity for routine follow-up care, likely resulting in complications and disability. Cellular telephones may provide a new tool to improve health outcomes. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of a mobile health follow-up program after injury in Cameroon. Methods Between February and October 2017, all injured patients admitted to a regional hospital in Cameroon were asked for mobile phone numbers as part of an existing trauma registry. Patients were contacted 2 weeks after leaving the hospital discharge to participate in a short triage survey. Data on program feasibility and patient condition were collected. Results Of 1180 injured patients who presented for emergency care, 83% provided telephone numbers, 62% were reached, and 48% (565) of all injured patients ultimately participated in telephone follow-up. Successfully contacted patients were reached after an average of 1.76 call attempts (SD 1.91) and median call time was 4.43 min (IQR 3.67-5.36). Five patients (1%) had died from their injuries at the time of follow-up. Among surveyed patients, 27% required ongoing assistance to complete activities of daily living. Nearly, half (47%) of patients reported inability to take medicines or care for their injury as instructed at discharge. Adequate pain control was achieved in only 38% of discharged patients. Conclusion Pilot data suggest considerable under treatment of injury in Cameroon. Mobile telephone follow-up demonstrates potential as a feasible tool for screening discharged patients who could benefit from further care.	[Christie, S. Ariane; Mbianyor, M.

In order to advance a mechanistic understanding of the injury to the optic nerve, we developed a head model with a biofidelic orbit. Head impacts were simulated under controlled conditions of impactor velocity. The locations of impact were varied to include frontal, lateral, and posterior parts of the head. Impact studies were conducted using two types of impactors that differed in their rigidity relative to the skull. The simulated results from both the impactors suggest that forehead impacts are those to which the optic nerve is most vulnerable. The mode and location of optic nerve injury is significantly different between the impacting conditions. Simulated results using a relatively rigid impactor (metal cylinder) suggest optic nerve injury initiates at the location of the intracranial end of the optic canal and spreads to the regions of the optic nerve in the vicinity of the optic canal. In this case, the deformation of the skull at the optic canal, resulting in deformation of the optic nerve, was the primary mode of injury. On the other hand, simulated results using a relatively compliant impactor (soccer ball) suggest that primary mode of injury comes from the brain tugging upon the optic nerve (from where it is affixed to the intracranial end of the optic canal) during coup countercoup motion of the brain. This study represents the first published effort to employ a biofidelic simulation of the full length of the optic nerve in which the orbit is integrated within the whole head.

Acute Dilation of Venous Sinuses in Animal Models of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Detected Using 9.4T MRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						transverse sinuses (TS); sinus dilation; venous drainage; superior sagittal sinus (SSS); MRI-magnetic resonance imaging; mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); concussion; animal model	SYMPTOMS; VEINS	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a debilitating but extremely common form of brain injury that affects a substantial number of people each year. mTBI is especially common in children and adolescents. Our understanding of mTBI pathophysiology is limited, and there is currently no accepted marker for disease severity. A potential marker for disease severity may be cerebrovascular dysfunction. Recent findings have implicated cerebrovascular alteration as an important component of mTBI and suggest it contributes to the development of persistent, long-term symptoms. In this paper, we conducted two studies to investigate whether mTBI affects venous drainage patterns in the central nervous system using alterations in the size of venous sinuses as a marker of changes in drainage. Using a closed head vertical weight-drop model and a lateral impact injury model of mTBI, we imaged and quantified the size of three major draining vessels in the adolescent rat brain using 9.4T MRI. Areas and volumes were quantified in the superior sagittal sinus and left and right transverse sinuses using images acquired from T2w MRI in one study and post-gadolinium T1w MRI in another. Our results indicated that the three venous sinuses were significantly larger in mTBI rats as compared to sham rats 1-day post injury but recovered to normal size 2 weeks after. Acutely enlarged sinuses post-mTBI may indicate abnormal venous drainage, and this could be suggestive of a cerebrovascular response to trauma.	[Shafqat, Qandeel; Hamilton, A.

To address grounded theory rigor and incorporate constructs such as the Person Environment Occupation Performance model, we revised the Hannold et al. (2013) conceptual framework. We conducted two focus groups with seven CVs. Conceptual framework revisions were based on an iterative process and thematic analysis. We elicited CVs' perspectives on deployment training, driving pre- and postdeployment, strategies, and intervention preferences. Personal, environmental, and task factors underpinned CVs' driving. Participants described triggers (e.g., stressful stimuli), use of environmental (e.g., car controls) or personal (e.g., avoiding traffic) strategies, and outcomes of appropriate or risky driving. Findings illustrated CVs' driving difficulty and informed development of a Veteran-centric driving intervention. Improving driving fitness has implications for Veterans' participation and community integration.

It is hypothesized, that with the adequate treatment of SDH in children and adolescence, excellent clinical and functional outcomes can be achieved. The aim of this study was to present the severity and outcome of traumatic SDH in children and adolescence as well as to analyze differences between patients treated surgically and conservatively. Methods In this study 47 infants and children with a subdural hematoma (SDH) were treated between 1992 and 2010 at a single level-one trauma center. Data regarding accident, treatment and outcomes were collected retrospectively. To classify the outcomes the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) scores at hospital discharge and at follow-up visits were used. Severity of SDH was classified according to the Rotterdam score. Results In total, 47 cases were treated (21 surgically, 26 conservatively), with 10 patients needing delayed surgery. Overall, 89% of the patients were able to leave hospital, 5 patients died, 2 patients (5%) within 24 & x202f;h, another 2 (5%) after 48 & x202f;h and 1 (2%) within 7 days. In 25 patients (53%) a good recovery was recorded at the last follow-up visit. Outcome was mainly influenced by the following factors: age, severity of TBI, and neurological status. Overall, in 70% good clinical and neurological outcomes could be achieved. Conclusion The results of this study confirmed that pediatric SDH is a rare, but serious condition. Despite a poor prognosis, most patients could be treated with good outcomes, given that the choice of treatment is correct.

Participants: Adults (>= 18 years old) from panels 9-19 (2004-2015) of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) who experienced a TBI (n = 949). Design: Data from MEPS, a nationally representative database of noninstitutionalized individuals in the USA, were used to 1) produce a national annual estimate of adults with TBI and 2) identify subgroups of patients with TBI who followed different general and mental health trajectories. Main Measures: Perceived general health (PGH), perceived mental health (PMH) Results: On average, 502 adults per 100,000 noninstitutionalized US adults experienced a TBI annually, and about one million adults are living with a TBI. Three distinct trajectory groups were identified in models of both perceived general health (PGH) and perceived mental health (PMH). TBI type, sex, and persistent disability predicted assignment to a group in the PGH model. TBI type, sex, age, insurance status, family poverty status, and persistent disability predicted assignment to a PMH trajectory. Conclusion: Referrals and early-intervention resources should be distributed to individuals with increased risk of following low PGH and/or PMH trajectories.

This preliminary study examined fMRI data from a clinical trial implementing a 4-week virtual reality driving intervention to assess how sustained training can improve deficits related to traumatic brain injury. Previously-reported behavioral findings showed improvements in working memory and processing speed in those who received the intervention; this report explores the brain bases of these effects by comparing neural activity related to working memory (n-back task) and resting state connectivity before and after the intervention. In the baseline visit (n = 24), working memory activity was prominent in bilateral DLPFC and prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial superior frontal gyrus, left thalamus, bilateral supramarginal / angular gyrus, precuneus, and left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Following intervention, participants showed less global activation on the n-back task, with regions of activity only in the bilateral middle frontal cortex, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. Activity related to working memory load was reduced for the group that went through the intervention (n = 7) compared to the waitlist control group (n = 4). These results suggest that successful cognitive rehabilitation of working memory in TBI may be associated with increased efficiency of brain networks, evidenced by reduced activation of brain activity during cognitive processing. These results highlight the importance of examining brain activity related to cognitive rehabilitation of attention and working memory after brain injury.

J	Hassan, TA; Mohey, N				Hassan, Tamir A.; Mohey, Nesreen			Reliability of MRI in detection and differentiation of acute neonatal/pediatric encephalopathy causes among neonatal/pediatric intensive care unit patients	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Encephalopathy; Metabolic disorders; MRI; White matter disorders; Neonate; Child	INBORN-ERRORS; THIAMINE; CHILDREN; INJURY	Background Causes of encephalopathy in neonates/pediatrics include hypoxic-ischemic injury (which is the most frequent cause and is defined as any impairment to the brain caused by insufficient blood flow and oxygenation), trauma, metabolic disorders, and congenital and infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of MRI in detection and possible differentiation of different non-traumatic, non-infectious causes of acute neonatal/pediatric encephalopathy among NICU/PICU patients. Results This retrospective study included 60 selected patients according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria; all presented with positive MRI findings for non-traumatic, non-infectious acute brain injury. Females (32, 53.3%) were affected more than males (28, 46.7%) with a mean age of 1.1 +/- 1.02 years; all presented with variable neurological symptoms and signs that necessitate neonatal intensive care unit/pediatric intensive care unit (NICU/PICU) admission. The final diagnosis of the study group patients were hypoxic ischemia injury (HII) in 39 patients (65%), metachromatic leukodystrophy in 6 patients (10%), biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD) and Leigh disease each in 4 patients (6.7%), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in 3 patients (5%), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) and non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) each in 2 patients (3.3%). Conclusion Much attention should be paid to pediatric non-traumatic brain injuries. MRI is a safe modality and should be the first radiological investigation if neurological causes are suggested but should be aided by meticulous clinical evaluation and dedicated laboratory investigations for better characterization and differentiation of various causes of non-traumatic, non-infective brain encephalopathy among NICU/PICU patients. When interpreting MRI, it is essential to have thorough relevant clinical data, gestational age at birth which is prognostic of the pattern of hypoxic-ischemic injury, and the time lag between the onset of HII and the time of performing the MR study.

J	Klocker, E; Pietsch, C; Pietsch, U				Klocker, E.; Pietsch, C.; Pietsch, U.			Treatment options for acute respiratory distress syndrome in neurointensive care. Individual management due to enhanced neuromonitoring? A case report series	ANAESTHESIST			German	Article						Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Intracranial pressure; Prismalung; Extracorporeal CO2 elimination; Neurointensive care	ACUTE LUNG INJURY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Severe pulmonary impairment can occur after traumatic brain injury or stroke. The resulting brain-lung interactions represent key points for the treatment and the subsequent outcome of the patient. Established treatment approaches, such as permissive hypercapnia and prone positioning, present the intensive care physician with divergent treatment goals in these patients with partially increased intracranial pressure. This case report series shows the instrument-based and noninstrument-based options for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the simultaneous presence of intracranial pathologies. This includes equipment based therapies using extracorporeal CO2 elimination, special positioning maneuvers in specially designed hospital beds and positional maneuvers, such as prone positioning. With enhanced neuromonitoring it is possible to optimally adapt treatment measures focused on the lungs early and before secondary damage to the brain.

J	Nichol, H; Boyd, J; Trier, J				Nichol, Heather; Boyd, John; Trier, Jessica			Seizure Prophylaxis Following Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Retrospective Investigation of Clinical Practice and the Impact of Clinical Guidelines	CUREUS			English	Article						traumatic brain injury (tbi); seizure; anticonvulsant; seizure prophylaxis	POSTTRAUMATIC SEIZURES; PHENYTOIN; LEVETIRACETAM; PREVENTION	Background Post-traumatic seizure (PTS) is a major complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there has been controversy in the literature regarding whether anticonvulsants should be used prophylactically to prevent it, and there is significant variability in practice. The objective of this study is to describe seizure prophylaxis practices after moderate to severe TBI and to determine whether the use of seizure prophylaxis increased following the recommendations of the Quebec Institut National d'Excellence en Sante et Services Sociaux and the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (INESSS-ONF) guidelines. This study will also compare the characteristics of patients who receive the recommended prophylaxis and those who do not. Methods All adult patients admitted to a level-1 trauma centre for moderate to severe TBI were eligible for this study (n = 96). Medical records including patient age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, mechanism of injury, and occurrence of PTS were reviewed in a retrospective manner regarding the administration of recommended seizure prophylaxis. Results The proportion of patients receiving the recommended seizure prophylaxis was 8%. There was no significant increase after the release of the INESSS-ONF guidelines (p: 0.38). There were no significant differences in demographics, injury characteristics, or rates of early PTS between patients receiving the recommended prophylaxis and those not receiving it (p: >0.05). Conclusion The results indicate that the use of the recommended seizure prophylaxis after moderate to severe TBI is low and that the release of the INESSS-ONF guidelines did not increase its use. Patient and injury factors do not appear to influence the use of seizure prophylaxis. These results highlight variability in seizure prophylaxis practices and the importance of understanding local practice patterns. Implementation strategies should be identified to increase adherence to the recommendations and improve patient care.

One-hundred eighty-nine equiosmolar bolus doses of HTS were administered to 43 patients (3% HTS, n = 84 doses; 6% HTS, n = 38 doses; 12% HTS, n = 67 doses) for episodes of acute intracranial hypertension (pressure above 20 mmHg). Significant reductions in ICP were observed at 30, 60, and 120 min following HTS boluses with the greatest decrease observed in patients receiving 12%. Thirty-four patients received a continuous infusion of HTS. Higher concentrations of HTS were associated with a more favorable fluid balance (p < .001), fewer episodes of pulmonary edema (p = .003), and higher intake of protein and energy (p < .001). Conclusions: Equiosmolar bolus doses of concentrated HTS were associated with significant reductions in ICP. Benefits of higher concentrations of continuous HTS may include improved fluid balance, less pulmonary edema, and greater amounts of protein and energy intake.

J	Moran, RN; Ingargiola, A				Moran, Ryan N.; Ingargiola, Alicia			Self-reported prior night's sleep quantity on baseline symptom factors and computerized neurocognitive testing in high school athletes	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-CHILD			English	Article						Baseline testing; neurocognitive performance; sleep duration; youth athletes	UNITED-STATES; SPORT; PERFORMANCE; CONCUSSION; DURATION; CONSEQUENCES; DEPRIVATION; DISORDERS; EXERCISE; STUDENTS	Little is known regarding sleep and baseline concussion performance and symptoms in athletes. We explored the effects of self-reported prior night's sleep quantity on baseline symptoms and computerized neurocognitive testing in high school athletes. A retrospective analysis of 958 high school athletes between the ages of 13-19 years was completed on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) performance. Participants were categorized into two groups based on self-reported prior night's sleep quantity: <8 h (n = 524; 55%) and >= 8 h (n = 434; 45%). Measures consisted of baseline total symptom score, symptom factors (vestibular-somatic, sleep-arousal, affective, and cognitive-sensory), and ImPACT composite scores (verbal and visual memory, visual-motor speed, reaction time, and impulse control). Significant differences were found on all baseline symptom factors (ps < .02) and total symptom scores (p < .001) with greater symptom reporting in the <8 h prior night's sleep group. No group differences were observed between duration and composite scores of verbal memory (p = .49), visual memory (p = .94), visual-motor speed (p = .38), reaction time (p = .50), or impulse control (p = .81). High school athletes who report <8 h of sleep the night prior to baseline concussion testing reported greater symptoms across all symptom factors. Clinicians should consider inadequate sleep the night prior to concussion testing to ensure accurate, valid assessments, especially on symptom reporting scales.

J	Finley, JC; Parente, F				Finley, John-Christopher; Parente, Frederick			Organization and recall of visual information after traumatic brain injury	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Subjective organization; recall; traumatic brain injury; association rules	SUBJECTIVE ORGANIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; PERFORMANCE	Background: Subjective organization (SO) is the ability to structure information to help facilitate storage and retrieval. There is a paucity of research concerning how a person subjectively organizes visual information. Objectives: This study investigates whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) hinders the ability to subjectively organize and recall visual symbols. The authors use an Association Rule Modeling (ARM) procedure to measure SO and explore whether the complexity of the rules generated from the ARM predicted recall of symbols. Method: Twenty-two collegiate athletes with self-reported, repetitive, mild TBI and 22 college students without TBI participated. All participants completed a list learning task that assessed their free recall of unfamiliar symbols. ARM revealed the associative structure among the symbols in the list for each participant. Results: Results showed that collegiate athletes with repetitive, mild TBI develop significantly fewer association rules for visual stimuli compared to college students without TBI. Furthermore, collegiate athletes with TBI produce fewer complex SO rules for the visual stimuli relative to college students without TBI. Conclusion: Brain injury diminishes a person's ability to subjectively organize novel visual information. ARM is a sensitive clinical measure of SO for patients with TBI.

J	Ishihara, T; Kondo, Y; Tanaka, H				Ishihara, Tadashi; Kondo, Yutaka; Tanaka, Hiroshi			Efficacy of venous access placement at a pre-hospital scene in severe paediatric trauma patients: a retrospective cohort study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ADVANCED LIFE-SUPPORT; INJURED PATIENTS; TIME; SURVIVAL; IMPACT; PRACTITIONERS; STABILIZATION; INTERVENTIONS; HEMORRHAGE; OPINIONS	Purpose: Aside from severe traumatic brain injury, uncontrolled bleeding and corresponding haemorrhage shock are the leading causes of traumatic deaths. No established recommendations exist about venous access placement for severely injured, bleeding children at a pre-hospital scene. This study sought to evaluate the association between pre-hospital venous access placement and mortality in a paediatric trauma population by analysing the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB). Methods: This epidemiologic study compared the outcomes of severe traumatic paediatric patients with or without venous access placement at a pre-hospital scene. Data were obtained from JTDB from 2004 to 2015. Results: Of 4,109 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 144 patients received venous access placement and 3,965 patients did not. The probability of survival was lower in the venous access group than in the no access group (0.90 [0.67-0.97] vs. 0.97 [0.90-0.99], p<0.01). After multivariable logistic analysis, venous access placement did not improve survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio = 1.40, confidence interval = 0.32-6.15, p=0.653). Conclusions: The probability of survival was lower in the venous access group than in the no access group. Survival outcome at discharge was not affected by venous access placement at a pre-hospital scene.

J	Shendyapina, M; Su, IF; Weekes, B				Shendyapina, Maria; Su, I-Fan; Weekes, Brendan			Cognitive assessment and rehabilitation tools for stroke and dementia: An online survey of Russian speaking clinicians	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-ADULT			English	Article; Early Access						Cognitive assessment; cognitive rehabilitation; dementia; stroke; survey; Russian	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AMERICAN-ACADEMY; IMPAIRMENT; GUIDELINES; BATTERY; APRAXIA; DIAGNOSIS; APHASIA; QUALITY; PEOPLE	Our objective was to survey opinions on cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of Russian-speaking clinicians working with stroke and dementia patients. An online survey was circulated to professional communities soliciting feedback from clinicians about methods used for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation; expected cognitive impairments in dementia and stroke; variables affecting the cognitive abilities of patients; and topics presented during psycho-educational initiatives. Forty-eight physicians, 50 psychologists, and 12 speech-language pathologists completed the survey. 96% of participants reported estimating the cognitive abilities of patients while performing diagnostics and treatment in clinical settings. The most popular tools for cognitive assessment were Russian versions of the MoCA, MMSE, Luria Neuropsychological Battery, and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). 60% of participants reported the provision of cognitive rehabilitation, and 61% provided psychoeducation. All groups reported that the cognitive reserve and the idiopathic features of a brain lesion were the main factors influencing patients' cognitive profile. In the case of stroke patients, clinicians observed aphasia, as well as impairments in attention, memory, and reasoning. For patients with dementia, memory deficits were coincident with executive/frontal, praxis, and visuo-perceptual impairments. Psychotherapy-related psychoeducation was delivered by most of the clinicians. The captured patterns of clinical practice followed, in part, Russian national guidelines for cognitive rehabilitation and, in part, international protocols, wherein we found some professional group differences in implementation of practice. The profile in approaches to stroke and dementia assessment and rehabilitation reveal a new benchmark for future studies and for the development of policies for neuropsychological assessment and treatment in Russian language.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of all male youth American football QB patients who sustained sports-related injuries at a regional pediatric medical center between 01/01/2003 and 10/01/2018. Patients were identified using HoundDog to search the term 'quarterback.' Records were then reviewed to identify all male QBs <= 18 years of age. Injures that were not a result of football participation were excluded. Main outcome variables were injured anatomic locations, injury types, surgical status, and settings in which the injury was sustained. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the outcome variables. Results: A total of 374 QBs (mean age: 14.6 +/- 2.1) sustained a total of 423 injuries. The top 5 injured anatomic locations were shoulder (22%), knee (15%) head/neck (14%), elbow (13%), and wrist/hand/lower arm (11%). Most injuries (64.3%) were acute; 35.7% were chronic in nature. Most acute injuries (55.5%) occurred during games. Of the chronic injuries, 47.0% occurred during off-season and 34.4% occurred in-season. Among all injuries, 22.9% were surgical cases, and the top 3 anatomic locations of surgery were knee (35.0%), shoulder (20.7%), and elbow (18.7%). Conclusions: The shoulder is the most commonly injured body part among young QBs seeking care in a regional pediatric medical center, although the knee is the most commonly injured body part that requires surgery. Most QB injuries are acute in mechanism and the majority of these acute injuries occur during games.

Design: The National Trauma Data Bank (2007-2015) was queried for blunt trauma patients age >16. Covariates (age >65, injury severity score [ISS] >25, traumatic brain injury, lung injury, pneumonia, severe sepsis, hypotension on admission, and blood transfusion) were included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Setting: Despite progress in the treatment for ARDS, it remains a significant concern. Racial differences in response to trauma and ARDS have been inconsistently demonstrated. Since these prior studies, ARDS has been redefined by the Berlin Criteria, advances in care have been made, and health-care accessibility has changed. Patients: Adult blunt trauma patients with ISS > 15 and length of stay >= 3 days to examine patients at high risk of ARDS. Measurements and Main Results: There were 28 727 patients with ARDS. Most were white (76.2%), followed by blacks (11.5%), Hispanics (11.3%), and Asians (1.8%). Overall mortality was 20.5%. Compared to whites, blacks (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.20, P < .001) had higher risk of ARDS, being Hispanic was protective (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.76-0.83, P < .001). Asians with ARDS were at greater risk of death (OR: 1.31, CI: 1.07-1.61, P < .05) while being black was not associated with risk of death. Patients with private insurance had less diagnosed ARDS and those with ARDS had lower mortality than other insurances (OR: 0.86, CI: 0.79-0.92, P < .001). Conclusions: Data from the National Trauma Data Bank (2007-2015) demonstrates racial and insurance disparities in the development of ARDS in blunt trauma patients. When compared to whites, blacks are at higher risk of developing ARDS while being Hispanic is protective. Likewise, Asians are at greatest risk of death and blacks have no difference in mortality when compared to whites. Patients with private insurance have lower risk of incidence and mortality.

First-in-Human Studies of MW01-6-189WH, a Brain-Penetrant, Antineuroinflammatory Small-Molecule Drug Candidate: Phase 1 Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Studies in Healthy Adult Volunteers	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						phase 1; cytokine; pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; brain injury; neuroinflammation	CYTOKINE UP-REGULATION; NEUROINFLAMMATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ACTIVATION; DISCOVERY; INJURY; MODEL	MW01-6-189WH (MW189) is a novel central nervous system-penetrant small-molecule drug candidate that selectively attenuates stressor-induced proinflammatory cytokine overproduction and is efficacious in intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury animal models. We report first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 studies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple ascending intravenous doses of MW189 in healthy adult volunteers. MW189 was safe and well tolerated in single and multiple doses up to 0.25 mg/kg, with no clinically significant concerns. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse event was infusion-site reactions, likely related to drug solution acidity. No clinically concerning changes were seen in vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical or neurological examinations, or safety laboratory results. PK analysis showed dose-proportional increases in plasma concentrations of MW189 after single or multiple doses, with approximately linear kinetics and no significant drug accumulation. Steady state was achieved by dose 3 for all dosing cohorts. A pilot pharmacodynamic study administering low-dose endotoxin to induce a systemic inflammatory response was done to evaluate the effects of a single intravenous dose of MW189 on plasma cytokine levels. MW189 treatment resulted in lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared with placebo treatment. The outcomes are consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of MW189. Overall, the safety profile, PK properties, and pharmacodynamic effect support further development of MW189 for patients with acute brain injury.

Ethnicity/race and service-connected disability disparities in civilian traumatic brain injury mechanism of injury and VHA health services costs in military veterans: Evidence from a Level 1 Trauma Center and VA Medical Center	TRAUMA-ENGLAND			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; veterans; injury mechanism; costs; disparities	ETHNIC DISPARITIES; REHABILITATION; DISCHARGE; SEVERITY; MODERATE; CARE; RACE	Introduction: The objective of this study was to examine the association of military veteran socio-demographics and service-connected disability with civilian mechanism of traumatic brain injury and long-term Veterans Health Administration (VHA) costs. Methods: We conducted a 17-year retrospective longitudinal cohort study of veterans with a civilian-related traumatic brain injury from a Level 1 Trauma Center between 1999 and 2013, with VHA follow-up through 2016. We merged trauma center VHA data, and used logit to model mechanism of injury, and generalized linear model to model VHA costs. Results: African American race or Hispanic ethnicity veterans had a higher unadjusted rate of civilian assault/gun as mechanism of injury (15.38%) relative to non-Hispanic White (7.19%). African American race or Hispanic veterans who were discharged from the trauma center with traumatic brain injury and followed in VHA had more than twice the odds of assault/gun (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.16:5.26), after adjusting for sex, age, and military service-connected disability. Veterans with service-connected disability >= 50% had more than twice the odds of assault/gun (OR 2.48; 95% CI 0.97: 6.31). Assault/gun was associated with significantly higher annual VHA costs post-discharge ($23,693; 95% CI $4265:$43,120) among non-Hispanic White veterans. Military service-connected disability >= 50% was associated with higher VHA costs among both non-Hispanic White ($43,565; 95% CI $15,531: $71,599) and African American race or Hispanic ($37,894; 95% CI $4537:$71,251) veterans. Conclusions: We found that African American race or Hispanic veterans had higher adjusted likelihood of assault/gun mechanism of traumatic brain injury, and non-Hispanic White veterans had higher adjusted annual VHA resource costs associated with assault/gun, post trauma center discharge. Veterans with higher than 50% service-connected disability had higher likelihood of assault/gun and higher adjusted annual VHA resource costs. Assault/gun prevention efforts may be indicated within the VHA, especially in minority and service-connected disability veterans. More data from Level 1 Trauma Centers are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.	[Dismuke-Greer, C. E.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, HERC, Ci2i, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Fakhry, S.

We aimed to study the infrared spectroscopic changes of alpha-helical proteins at post-traumatic epileptic (PTE) foci by FTIR. FITR mapping was applied to detect alpha-helical proteins in rat brain tissue samples with post-traumatic epilepsy. Histological examination of brain sections showed that the rat model of PTE was successfully established. At the PTE foci, high alpha-helical absorption regions were evident, where the color difference and absorption were significantly different from those in the low-absorption regions. This provided a distinctive and characteristic pattern at the site of lesions.

The diagnosis is often missed or delayed, leading to complications such as functional deficits or osteonecrosis of the humeral head. Closed reduction can be utilized following an initial occurrence, however, repeated insult to the glenohumeral joint may lead to posterior instability. A reverse Hill-Sachs lesion, a vertical impacted fracture of the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head, can occur. Surgical treatment options for posterior instability include the modified McLaughlin procedure also known as the reverse remplissage procedure. Unfortunately, the success rates of this procedure are controversial.

A retrospective chart review of 124 children aged <1 year diagnosed with TBI were analyzed. Outcomes were evaluated at discharge and 6 months later by using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) Scale. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine the cutoff values for hemoglobin (HB) levels. In the study, 50 infants (40.3%) achieved a favorable neurologic outcome (PCPC <= 2) and 74 (59.7%) had poor neurologic outcomes (PCPC >= 3). Infants with poor neurologic outcomes had lower HB on admission and nadir HB (p < 0.05). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, the nadir HB was a predictor of poor neurologic outcomes at discharge and 6 months later in both AHT and accidental head injury. Nadir HB had the largest area under the ROC curve for predicting poor neurologic outcomes. We determined the appropriate cutoff value of nadir HB as 9.35 g/dl for predicting neurologic outcomes in infants with TBI. Furthermore, the cutoff value of nadir HB in predicting poor neurologic outcomes in infants caused by AHT and accidental head injury were taken as 9.36 and 8.75 g/dl, respectively.

The diffusion-tensor imaging reveals alterations in water diffusion parameters in acute pediatric concussion	ACTA NEUROLOGICA BELGICA			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI); Fractional anisotropy (FA); Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); Thalamus; Corpus callosum	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AXONAL INJURY; MILD; ABNORMALITIES; INTEGRITY; THALAMUS	Wide-spread visualization methods which are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not sensitive to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, mTBI may cause changes of cerebral microstructure that could be found using diffusion-tensor imaging. The aim of this study is to reveal the impact of acute mTBI (no more than 3 days after trauma) on diffusion parameters in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and thalamus in children (aged 14-18). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were analyzed. Significant increase in FA and decrease in ADC were observed in thalamus. The trend to an increase in FA is observed in corpus callosum.	[Vasiukova, O. R.; Akhlebinina, M., I; Manzhurtsev, A., V; Ublinskiy, M., V; Yakovlev, A. N.; Akhadov, T. A.; Semenova, N.

Clinical utility of WAIS-IV 'excessive decline from premorbid functioning' scores to detect invalid test performance following traumatic brain injury	CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; test of premorbid functioning; performance validity; effort; excessive decline	SYMPTOM VALIDITY TEST; MALINGERED NEUROCOGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; EVALUATION CONTEXT; CROSS-VALIDATION; POOR EFFORT; MEMORY TEST; DIGIT SPAN; TEST-II; VETERANS	Objective: Excessive Decline from Premorbid Functioning (EDPF), an atypical discrepancy between demographically predicted and obtained Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-4th Edition (WAIS-IV) scores, has been recently proposed as a potential embedded performance validity test (PVT). This study examined the clinical utility of EDPF scores to detect invalid test performance following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Participants were 194 U.S. military service members who completed neuropsychological testing on average 2.4 years (SD = 4.0) following uncomplicated mild, complicated mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI (Age: M = 34.0, SD = 9.9). Using TBI severity and PVT performance (i.e., PVT Pass/Fail), participants were classified into three groups: Uncomplicated Mild TBI-PVT Fail (MTBI-Fail; n = 21), Uncomplicated Mild TBI-PVT Pass (MTBI-Pass; n = 94), and Complicated Mild to Severe/Penetrating TBI-PVT Pass (CM/STBI-Pass; n = 79). Seven EDPF measures were calculated by subtracting WAIS-IV obtained index scores from the demographically predicted scores from the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF). Cutoff scores to detect invalid test performance were examined for each EDPF measure separately. Results: The MTBI-Fail group had higher scores than the MTBI-Pass and CM/STBI-Pass groups on five of the seven EDPF measures (p<.05). Overall, the EDPF measure using the Processing Speed Index (EDPF-PSI) was the most useful score to detect invalid test performance. However, sensitivity was only low to moderate depending on the cutoff score used. Conclusions: These findings provide support for the use of EDPF as an embedded PVT to be considered along with other performance validity data when administering the WAIS-IV.

Association Between Self-Reported Traumatic Brain Injury and Threat/Control-Override	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Head injury; TBI; threat; control-override (TCO); psychosis	PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS; MENTAL-ILLNESS; SUBSTANCE USE; RISK-FACTOR; FOLLOW-UP; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; GENERAL-POPULATION; JUVENILE-OFFENDERS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES	Prior research has focused on the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), psychosis, and threat/control-override (TCO) on violent behavior. There is, however, a lack of research exploring the potential connection between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and TCO. This study is designed to partially address this gap in the literature. To do so, a sample of delinquent youths followed to early adulthood is examined to estimate if self-reported TBI is associated with the development of TCO symptomatology. The results indicate that, although there is an association between TBI and psychoticism, TBI was not significantly associated with TCO, net of other variables in both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. The results suggest, however, that paranoid ideation and psychoticism consistently predict TCO. Finally, the findings indicate that TCO does not consistently mediate the relationship between TBI and violent crime.

Aim We studied demographic, medical history, injury experience, and mortality factors to determine their association with abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone in pediatric trauma patients. Methods The 414 pediatric trauma patients were from those seen at an emergency department. The primary outcome variable was abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone. Secondary outcome variables were abnormal high and abnormal low thyroid-stimulating hormone. Predictor variables were demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index), medical history (thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, psychiatric disease), injury experience (injury cause, injury severity score >= 15, moderate/severe traumatic brain injury, length of stay), and mortality (mortality, survival probability). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results There were 8.0% (n = 33) with any abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. In the analysis for abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone, females (odds ratio:4.95, 95% confidence interval: 2.01, 12.21, p < 0.01) and traumatic brain injury (odds ratio: 8.11, 95% confidence interval: 2.51, 26.16, p < 0.001) were each significantly associated with increased odds. In the analysis for abnormal high thyroid-stimulating hormone (odds ratio: 3.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.37, 10.24, p < 0.05), traumatic brain injury (odds ratio: 11.59, 95% confidence interval: 3.45, 38.97, p < 0.001), and mortality (odds ratio: 35.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.40, 906.57, p < 0.05) were each significantly associated with increased odds. In the analysis for abnormal low thyroid-stimulating hormone, only females (odds ratio: 11.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.26, 97.60, p < 0.05) were significantly associated with increased odds. Conclusion In conclusion, females and traumatic brain injury have increased odds for abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone. Mortality has increased odds for abnormal high thyroid-stimulating hormone. We suggest that clinicians in the pediatric trauma setting carefully monitor females and traumatic brain injury patients with abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone.

Study Design: Prospective/Observational study Place and Duration of Study: Department of Neurosurgery, Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur from 1st July 2019 to 31st December 2019. Methods: Sixty two patients of both genders presented with traumatic brain injury undergoing decompressive craniectomy were included. Patient's detailed demographics including age, gender, cause of injury and site were recorded. Preoperatively Glasgow coma scale was used to examine the severity. Final outcomes were examined by Glasgow outcome scale. Follow-up was taken at postoperatively 3 months. Results: Forty two (67.74%) were males while 20(32.26%) were females. Mean age of patients was 34.26 +/- 13.57 years (ranges 12 to 65 years). Fifty one (82.26%) patients had severe, 9(14.51%) had moderate and 2(3.23%) had mild injury as Glasgow coma scale. Thirty eight (61.29%) patients had favorable outcomes while 15(24.19%) had unfavorable outcomes and mortality found in 9 (14.52%) patients. Complications found in 7(11.29%) patients. Conclusion: Decompressive craniectomy is safe and effective treatment modality for traumatic brain injury with high rate of favorable outcomes. Also it is very helpful for reducing the intracranial pressure.

The overall prognosis is poor, particularly when large hematoma exists. This study was designed to compare surgical evacuation through transsylvian-transinsular approach with conservative management in large TBGHs. METHODS: Thirty-two patients, admitted between July 2002 and July 2013, with closed head injury and TBGH more than 25 mL were included in this study. Among these patients, sixteen were conservatively managed whereas another sixteen patients underwent hematoma evacuation via transsylvian-transinsular approach. The modified Rankin scale was used to assess the functional outcomes of patients for at least 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between two groups with respect to age (21.0 vs. 18.9 years, P=0.635), sex (P=0.220), and admission GCS Score (7.5 vs. 6.5, P=0.234). The patients treated with surgical approach revealed a better functional outcome compared to the conservative group (68.8% vs. 31.3%, P=0.043). The mean of late TBGH volume in the conservative group was less than surgical group (33.9 mL vs. 40.0 mL, P=0.047). The mortality rates were not significantly different between the surgical and conservative groups (18.8% vs. 37.5%, P=1.000). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that hematoma evacuation through a transsylvian-transinsular approach improves the functional outcome in patients with TBGH.

Surveillance of concussion-related injuries using electronic medical records from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN): a proof-of-concept	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Concussion; Mild traumatic brain injury; Injury; Electronic medical records; ICD coding classification; Surveillance	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADULTS; TRENDS	Introduction Previous studies on traumatic brain injury trends in Canada have been restricted to hospitalization and emergency department visit data. However, many concussion patients may present first, or only, to family physicians. Therefore, the true burden of concussion in Canada is likely underestimated. The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) collects information electronically from family physicians across Canada and can potentially be used for concussion surveillance. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using data collated from CPCSSN for concussion surveillance purposes and examine trends over time. Methods Electronic medical records housed by CPCSSN from 2010 to 2016 were analyzed. Case ascertainment was determined through a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Binomial regression models were used to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR) of concussion by age, sex, deprivation indices, body mass index, and comorbid conditions. Results Concussion prevalence rates increased from 2010 to 2016 (p < 0.001). Based on 2016 data, males had a higher prevalence of concussion compared with females (PR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.02, 1.18), and those aged 10-14 (PR = 8.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.34, 11.44) and 15-19 (PR = 7.75; 95% CI 5.84, 10.28) had higher prevalence of concussion compared with those aged 0-4 years. Conclusion This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using the CPCSSN system for surveillance of concussion in the Canadian population.

J	Billeck, J; Peeler, J				Billeck, Jeffrey; Peeler, Jason			The influence of fatiguing exercise on Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) scoring in a female pediatric population	PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE			English	Article						Concussion; assessment; pediatric; exercise; reliability	SEX-DIFFERENCES; UNITED-STATES; INJURY RATES; SYMPTOMS; YOUTH	There is currently a lack of information available about the effect that exercise fatigue may have on Child Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) scoring in a pediatric population. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the influence of a fatiguing bout of aerobic exercise on Child Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) scoring in an adolescent female sporting population. Methods: A prospective, observational-based, test-retest study design was used to collect Child SCAT data from thirty healthy 9-12 year old physically active females during two testing sessions that occurred a minimum of 7 days apart. Within each testing session, each child completed a fatiguing bout of aerobic exercise, and the Child SCAT was administered: (1). Pre-exercise and (2). Post-exercise. Parametric and non-parametric testing was used to compare aerobic exercise test results and pre- vs. post-exercise Child SCAT data. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1) analysis. Results: No significantly differences were noted between pre- and post-exercise Child SCAT data during either test day. ICC values suggested that a majority of the individual components of the Child SCAT demonstrated poor test-retest reliability. Conclusion: Clinicians using the Child SCAT as a sideline assessment tool during youth sport should have confidence that individual component scores are uninfluenced by aerobic exercise completed immediately prior to assessment. But, clinicians should also be cautioned against using Child SCAT data from consecutive testing days when making decisions about patient recovery and return-to-sport timelines.

Assessment of anxiety in older adults: psychometric properties and relationships with self-reported functional impairment	INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Article						geriatric anxiety scale; geriatric anxiety inventory; older adults; psychometric properties; functional impairment	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SHORT-FORM; MECHANICAL TURK; INVENTORY; DEPRESSION; SCALE; VALIDATION; DISORDER; BIFACTOR; CARE	Objective: The current study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of two geriatric anxiety measures: the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS). This study also aimed to determine the relationships of these measures with two measures of functional ability and impairment: the Barkley Functional Impairment Scale (BFIS) and the Everyday Cognition Scale (E-Cog). Design: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were used to analyze the factor structures of the GAI and GAS in older adults. Tests for dependent correlations were used to examine the relationship between anxiety scales and functioning. Setting: Amazon's Mechanical Turk Participants: 348 participants (aged 55-85, M= 62.75 (4.8), 66.5% female) with no history of psychosis or traumatic brain injury. Results: CFAs supported the previously demonstrated bifactor solution for the GAI. For the GAS, the previously demonstrated three-factor model demonstrated a good-to-excellent fit. Given the high correlation between the cognitive and affective factors (r =.89), a bifactor solution was also tested. The bifactor model of the GAS was found to be primarily unidimensional. Tests for dependent correlations revealed that the GAS demonstrated stronger relationships with measures of self-reported functional impairment than the GAI. Conclusions: The current study provides further psychometric validation of the factor structure of two geriatric anxiety measures in an older adult sample. The results support previous work completed on the GAI and the GAS. The GAS was more strongly correlated with self-reported functional impairment than the GAI, which may reflect differences in content in the two measures.

Does hypertension at initial presentation adversely affect outcomes in pediatric traumatic brain injury?	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Hypertension; Pediatrics	BLOOD-PRESSURE; ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION; SEVERITY SCORE; HEAD-INJURY; CHILDREN; HYPOTENSION; ASSOCIATION; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	Background: Adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who present hypertensive suffer worse outcomes and increased mortality compared to normotensive patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if age-adjusted hypertension on presentation is associated with worsened outcomes in pediatric TBI. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on pediatric patients with severe TBI admitted to a single system pediatric tertiary care center. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, need for neurosurgical intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, and the need for inpatient rehabilitation. Results: Of 150 patients, 70% were hypertensive and 30% were normotensive on presentation. Comparing both groups, no statistically significant differences were noted in mortality (13.3% for both groups), need for neurosurgical intervention (51.4% vs 48.8%, p = 0.776), length of stay (6 vs 8 days, p = 0.732), duration of mechanical ventilation (2 vs 3 days, p = 0.912), or inpatient rehabilitation rates (48.6% vs 48.9%, p = 0.972). In comparing just the hypertensive patients, there was a trend toward increased mortality in the 95th and 99th percentile groups at 15.8% and 14.1%, versus the 90th percentile group at 6.7% but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.701). Conclusions: Contrary to the adult literature, pediatric patients with severe TBI and hypertension on presentation do not appear to have worsened outcomes compared to those who are normotensive. However, a trend toward increased mortality did exist at extremes of age adjusted hypertension. Larger scale studies are needed to validate these findings.

In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we used a subset of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, involving 1 million randomly selected beneficiaries. Patients with newly diagnosed COPD between 2000 and 2008 were identified. They were subgrouped as 'COPDAE+' (if they had severe acute exacerbation of COPD during the follow-ups) or 'COPDAE-' (if they had no acute exacerbation), and were frequency matched with randomly selected subjects without COPD (the 'non-COPD' group). Baseline differences were balanced by the inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the propensity score. For each patient, the risk of TBI during the subsequent 5 years was determined. The competing risk of death was controlled. We identified 3734 patients in 'COPDAE+', and frequency matched them with 11,202 patients in 'COPDAE-' and 11,202 subjects in 'non-COPD'. Compared with those in 'non-COPD', patients in 'COPDAE+' and 'COPDAE-' had an increased risk of TBI: the adjusted HR for 'COPDAE+' was 1.50, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.73, and that for 'COPDAE-' was 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.34. The highest risk was observed in the 'COPDAE+' group that aged <65 (the adjusted HR was 1.92; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.64). COPD has been linked to complications beyond the respiratory system. In this study we showed that COPD is associated with an increased risk of TBI.

The aim of the study was to examine change in functional skills and independence over time in children with moderate-severe brain injury during prolonged inpatient rehabilitation. Design This study used a retrospective cohort design. Longitudinal data from 139 children (age 1.6-20.6 yrs), hospitalized for 115.4 +/- 72 days, were examined. Growth curve analysis was used to examine factors associated with change in the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (functional skills and caregiver assistance, ie, functional independence) in mobility and self-care. Typical estimates for change per hospitalization day were obtained. Results Traumatic brain injury and older age at injury, but not sex, were associated with faster recovery. Length of stay was associated with rate of change in functional skills but not in functional independence, suggesting that improvement in functional independence during rehabilitation may be associated with other factors.

J	Lengwiler, F; Heckmann, J; Sturm, V				Lengwiler, Fabian; Heckmann, Jan; Sturm, Veit			Ocular Motor Nerve Palsies Caused by Paragliding Accidents	KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE			German	Article						paragliding accident; incomitant strabismus; ocular motor nerve palsy; eye muscle surgery	INJURIES	Background Paragliding is a risk-taking adventure sport. It can be performed either individually or accompanied by a pilot in tandem formation. Paragliding, as well as other types of "extreme" sport, have gained popularity over the past few years. Injuries predominantly involve the lower extremities and the spinal column. Head injuries occur only rarely. Patients andMethods Retrospective case series of three patients with ocular motor nerve palsies caused by paragliding accidents. Patients' characteristics with special emphasis on treatment strategies are reported. Results Twomen (41 and 56 years of age) suffered from open head injuries and one 56-year-old male from a closed head injury as part of polytrauma caused by paragliding accidents. All patients complained of double vision. The first patient showed a right abducens nerve palsy and elevation deficit due to a complex orbital fracture. Patient 2 had a traumatic right six nerve palsy. The third patient had a complex motility disorder with a bilateral abducens and trochlear nerve palsy. In all three cases, eye muscle surgery improved ocular motility. Two patients regained binocular single vision. Conclusions Characteristics of injuries caused by paragliding accidents depend on the trauma scenario. Injury pattern might differ widely. Ocular motor nerve palsies often accompany head trauma. Treatment is guided by common strategies for incomitant strabismus. These ocular motility disorders are often complex and require an individually tailored approach.

METHODS: A TBI model was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using Feeney's freefall impact method. Acupuncture to stimulate the Yamen (GV 15), Fengfu (GV 16), Baihui (GV 20), Shuigou (GV 26) and Hegu (LI 4) acupoints was performed on the TBI rats. After 3 consecutive days of acupuncture treatment, we investigated signal molecules, receptors and microglia related to neuroinflammation in brain tissue of the TBI rats and analyzed the possible mechanism underlying the effect of acupuncture on neuroinflammation. RESULTS: After the acupuncture treatment, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(lba1), a protein specific to microglia, was investigated. In the cortical layer of damaged brain tissue in TBI rats, the Iba1-positive area was 3.3% +/- 0.9% in the rats that received acupuncture compared with 5.2% +/- 1.4% in the TBI rats that did not receive acupuncture, and the microglia were smaller with more slender protrusions in the acupuncture-treated rats. This result indicates that acupuncture can significantly reduce microglia activation in TBI rats. A possible mechanism for this effect is that acupuncture reduces the expression of autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid. Together, these constitute the autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid axis, which induces microglial activation in the brains of TBI rats. Acupuncture treatment may downregulate the expression of Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor (LPAR) 1 and LPAR2 on the microglial cytomembrane, which affects the microglia activation process. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture stimulating the Yamen (GV 15), Fengfu (GV 16), Baihui (GV 20), Shuigou (GV 26) and Hegu (LI 4) acupoints can effectively inhibit the development of neuroinflammation after TBI. One possible mechanism for this effect is that acupuncture downregulates LPA synthesis and affects the LPA-LPAR pathway by inhibiting LPAR1 and LPAR2, thereby inhibiting microglial activation and reducing neuroinflammation.

Methods: This study retrospectively investigated the clinical records of 144 patients treated at a teaching hospital due to a tornado. Each patient's demographic data, diagnosis, injury types, causes of injury, infection status, and outcomes were all reviewed. Results: Of the 144 patients, 64 (44.4%) were male, and 80 (55.6%) were female. The patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 94 years; 91 (63.19%) were admitted within the first 12 h after the disaster. The most frequently injured sites were the body surfaces (24.48%), followed by the limbs and pelvis (21.79%) and chest (20.3%). Soft-tissue injuries and fractures were the most frequent injuries. Traumatic brain injuries were the main causes of death. Tornado-related injuries were primarily caused by flying/falling bricks, wood, and glass. Twenty-three (15.9%) patients suffered from infections, which consisted mainly of skin/soft tissue infections and pneumonia. Conclusions: Destructive tornadoes often cause heavy casualties with little warning. Medical aid agencies must be prepared to accommodate the massive numbers of injured patients after a catastrophe.

Signals of the illness may include physiological alterations in the organism, tissues, cells, proteins, and gene levels. Therefore, PTSD has been understood as a systemic disease that affects not only the brain but also the whole body. Heterogeneity in susceptibility to PTSD suggests that the response of an individual to trauma may depend on gender as well as the type of adverse event experienced. In addition, people who meet PTSD diagnostic criteria are heterogeneous, as demonstrated by differences in treatment response, course, and symptoms. According to evidence, there is a need to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in PTSD especially looking for the identification of specific biomarkers for the disease. PTSD biomarkers could be used to improve the disease's diagnosis, early identification of cases, treatment decision-making, and new drug development. Here we review the recent literature available in Pubmed investigating the main biochemical mechanisms involved in PTSD and the methodologies applied for the assessment of the disease. In addition to trauma-induced alterations, PTSD presents pre-exposure vulnerability factors. The disease has been found to be associated with the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunctions. Changes in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) play a role in PTSD by releasing epinephrine and norepinephrine. The release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex amplifies the SNS response. Later through negative feedback mechanisms, the cortisol level is decreased in patients with PTSD, especially in women. The women's increased vulnerability to PTSD may be due to gender differences in normal HPA reactivity. That negative feedback contributes to neuroendocrine alterations, promoting structural brain changes that finally culminate in PTSD. Abnormal levels of serotonin and dopamine have been found in the disease. Mechanisms like the alterations in mitochondrial energy handling and induction of neuroinflammation are also associated with PTSD.

Development and Validation of a Hospital Indicator of Activity-Based Costs for Injury Admissions	VALUE IN HEALTH			English	Article						activity-based costing; benchmark; indicator; interprovider variations; resource use; risk-adjustment model trauma		Objectives: To develop a hospital indicator of resource use for injury admissions. Methods: We focused on resource use for acute injury care and therefore adopted a hospital perspective. We included patients >= 16 years old with an Injury Severity Score.9 admitted to any of the 57 trauma centers of an inclusive Canadian trauma system from 2014 to 2018. We extracted data from the trauma registry and hospital financial reports and estimated resource use with activity-based costing. We developed risk-adjustment models by trauma center designation level (I/II and III/IV) for the whole sample, traumatic brain injuries, thoraco-abdominal injuries, orthopedic injuries, and patients >= 65 years old. Candidate variables were selected using bootstrap resampling. We performed benchmarking by comparing the adjusted mean cost in each center, obtained using shrinkage estimates, to the provincial mean. Results: We included 38 713 patients. The models explained between 12% and 36% (optimism-corrected r2) of the variation in resource use. In the whole sample and in all subgroups, we identified centers with higher- or lower-than-expected resource use across level I/II and III/IV centers. Conclusions: We propose an algorithm to produce the indicator using data routinely collected in trauma registries to prompt targeted exploration of potential areas for improvement in resource use for injury admissions. The r(2) of our models suggest that between 64% and 88% of the variation in resource use for injury care is dictated by factors other than patient baseline risk.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the English language literature to address this question. Main outcomes and results: Four prospective cohort trials of serum S100B levels on acutely intoxicated patients with MTBI were included in this meta-analysis. Prevalence of intracranial pathology in the pooled cohort of the intoxicated MTBI patients was 10%, lower than the 15-30% reported in the literature for the general MTBI population. Standard mean difference of serum S100B levels between patients with and without intracranial pathology on CT was 0.73 mu g/L (Z = 18.33, P < 0.001). Following sensitivity analysis and hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic models, three remaining articles were used for pooled estimates that found that S100B had a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.84-1.00, I2 = 0%) and specificity of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.58-0.68, I2 = 86.8%) with a high negative predictive value (100%, 95% CI: 95.14-100, I2 = 0%) and a negative LR of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01-0.31). Conclusions: Serum S100B levels may have utility in ruling out intracranial pathology in intoxicated patients, however more study and comparison with other serum biomarkers of brain injury are necessary before this becomes the accepted standard of care.

Besides neurological sequelae, neuropsychological deficits largely contribute to patients' long-term quality of life. Little is known about the pituitary gland volume (PGV) after SAH compared to healthy referents and the association of PGV with long-term outcome including cognitive function. Methods Sixty consecutive non-traumatic SAH patients admitted to the neurological intensive care unit between 2010 and 2014 were enrolled. 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imagining was performed at baseline (16 days) and 12 months after SAH to measure PGV semi-automatically using the software iPlan Net 3.5.0. PGV was compared to age and sex matched healthy referents. The difference between baseline and 1-year-PGV was classified as increase (> 20 mm(3) PGV increase), stable (+/- 20 mm(3)), or decrease (> 20 mm(3) PGV decrease). In addition, total intracerebral volume was calculated. Neuropsychological testing was applied in 43 SAH patients at 1-year follow up encompassing several domains (executive, attention, memory) and self-assessment (questionnaire for self-perceived deficits in attention [German: FEDA]) of distractibility in mental processes, fatigue and decrease in motivation. Multivariable regression with multivariable generalized linear models was used for comparison of PGVs and for subgroup analysis to evaluate a potential association between PGV and neuropsychological outcome. Results Patients were 53 years old (IQR = 44-63) and presented with a median Hunt&Hess grade of 2 (IQR = 1-3). SAH patients had a significantly lower PGV both at baseline (360 +/- 19 mm(3), p < 0.001) and 1 year (367 +/- 18 mm(3)p < 0.001) as compared to matched referents (mean 505 +/- 18 mm(3)). PGV decreased by 75 +/- 8 mm(3) in 28 patients, increased by 120 +/- 22 mm(3) in 22 patients and remained stable in 10 patients at 1-year follow-up. PGV in patients with PGV increase at 12 months was not different to healthy referents (p = 0.062). Low baseline PGV was associated with impaired executive functions at 1 year (adjOR = 8.81, 95%-CI = 1.46-53.10, p = 0.018) and PGV decrease within 1 year was associated with self-perceived worse motivation (FEDA; Wald-statistic = 6.6, df = 1, p = 0.010). Conclusions Our data indicate significantly lower PGVs following SAH. The association of sustained PGV decrease with impaired neuropsychological long-term outcome warrants further investigations including neuroendocrine hormone measurements.

The pathophysiology of SCI includes a primary injury followed by a cascade of secondary biochemical and cellular changes. Current pharmacological options are limited for significant recovery from SCI. The beta-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone (CEF) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have shown to induce neuroprotection in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CEF, NAC, and their combination on the functional recovery and histological damage in experimental SCI. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7): Saline, CEF, NAC, and CEF + NAC. Then, SCI was performed on rats under general anesthesia using the Neurosciences Research Center (NSRC) impactor. Locomotor recovery following SCI was monitored using the locomotor rating scale of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB). At the end of the study, all rats were sacrificed, and spinal cord cross-sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological evaluation. Results: The CEF and NAC administration, either alone or in combination (CEF + NAC), significantly improved locomotor recovery following SCI in rats when compared to the saline group. The histological analysis showed that the severity of histopathological lesion in the spinal cord of rats was significantly lower in the CEF, NAC, and CEF + NAC groups than in the saline group. Conclusions: Treatment with CEF and NAC, either separately or in combination, promotes locomotor recovery following SCI, which is associated with the effective reduction of the histopathological lesion.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability in the paediatric population, although the literature on the Spanish population is scarce. From the perspective of early vulnerability, recent research findings suggest that early brain injury has worse sequelae and a higher risk of impact. Aims. To analyse the intelligence profile, executive functions and behaviour, and examine the association between age at the time of the injury, severity of the TBI and environmental factors for cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Patients and methods. Seventy-one participants with moderate to severe TBI, from 6 to 16 years of age, were assessed with measures of intelligence (intelligence quotient), executive functions and behaviour. Results. Children with TBI are at increased risk of disability in all aspects of intelligence, executive functions and behaviour. Children who suffered a traumatic brain injury in infancy and the preschool period had more overall effects on intelligence quotient and some aspects of the executive functions. Conclusions. Socioeconomic and cultural factors are the best predictors for intelligence quotient and behaviour. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the sequelae of TBI in children, which will help in rehabilitation planning and re-adaptation to functional life.

Using a recently-established 3D in-vitro neural hydrogel model for mTBI we investigated the efficacy of TH after compressive impact injury and established critical treatment parameters including target cooling temperature, and time windows for application and maintenance of TH. Across four temperatures evaluated (31.5, 33, 35, and 37 degrees C), 33 degrees C was found to be most neuroprotective after 24 and 48 hours post-injury. Assessment of TH administration onset time and duration showed that TH should be administered within 4 hours post-injury and be maintained for at least 6 hours for achieving maximum viability. Cellular imaging showed TH reduced the percentage of cells positive for caspases 3/7 and increased the expression of calpastatin, an endogenous neuroprotectant. These findings provide significant new insight into the biological parameter space that renders TH effective in mitigating the deleterious effects of cellular mTBI and provides a quantitative foundation for the future development of animal and preclinical treatment protocols.

Head injured patients are a sensitive group that can benefit from early advanced measures to protect the airway, with the objective to reduce hypoxia and maintain normocapnia. Problem: The occurrence of endotracheal intubation to patients with severe head injuries by prehospital physicians working at Mexico City's Service of Emergency Medical Care (SAMU) is unknown. Methods: A retrospective analysis of five-year data (2012-2016) from Mexico City's Medical Emergencies Regulation Center was performed. Only SAMU ambulance services were analyzed. Adult patients with a prehospital diagnosis of head injury based on mechanism of injury and physical examination with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Results: A total of 293 cases met the inclusion criteria; the mean GCS was five points. Of those, 150 (51.1%) patients were intubated. There was no difference in the occurrence of intubation among the different GCS scales, or if the patient was considered to have isolated head trauma versus polytrauma. Fifteen patients were intubated using sedation and neuromuscular blockage. Four patients were intubated with sedation alone and six patients with neuromuscular blockage alone. One patient was intubated using opioid analgesia, sedation, and neuromuscular blockage. Conclusions: Patients with severe head injuries cared by prehospital physicians in Mexico City were intubated 51.1% of the time and were more likely to be intubated without the assistance of anesthetics.

Study Design: Retrospective study Place and Duration of Study: Department of Forensic Medicine& Toxicology and Department of Pathology, Peoples University of Medical & Health Sciences for Women, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sindh from 1stJanuary 2014 to 31st December 2018. Methodology: Eighty three cases with head injury were reported, of them 48 had brain stem hemorrhage. Brain autopsy was performed, and findings are reported. Results: The mean age of patients was 57.12 +/- 6.24 years. Mid brain hemorrhage was found in 20(41.6%) patients while pontine hemorrhage was found in 10( 20.8%) patients. Eight (16.6%) patients had hemorrhage at medulla, 7(14.5%) patients had hemorrhage at the ponto-medullary junction, while 3(6.2%) patients had hemorrhage at cervico-medullary junction. The most common mode of injury was road traffic accidents (n=23) followed by assault (n=14), blow to the neck (n=9) and fall (n=2). Conclusion: most common site for hemorrhage in brainstem was midbrain followed by pons and medulla. Traumatic brainstem injuries are often associated with lesions at other sites of brain and poor prognosis. The most common mode of injury in our study was road traffic accidents.

No injury data among junior synchronized skaters exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and pattern of injuries in junior and senior synchronized skaters. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiology study anonymous questionnaires were distributed to synchronized junior and senior skaters. 708 synchronized skaters (393 juniors and 315 seniors) completed the questionnaire. Male skaters were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Spinal conditions were reported by 148 (37.7%) juniors compared to 149 (47.3%) of senior skaters with statistically significant cumulative incidence (P=0.01); 23% of juniors and 30.2% of senior skaters reported problems with more than one spinal region; 64.4% juniors and 72.1% senior skaters reported at least one non-spinal injury during their synchronized skating career. There were 380 unique injuries reported by junior skaters and 363 by senior skaters. Lower extremity injuries were the most common injuries in both groups of skaters, followed by upper extremity, head and trunk injuries. From all the anatomical regions mentioned, there was only statistically significant difference between the groups in the occurrence of head injuries with senior skaters having 1.9 greater odds ratio to have head injury. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents new data on the current injury pattern seen in synchronized skating since the inclusion of new skills. The number of head injuries and spinal conditions show statistically significant cumulative incidence in senior compared to junior skaters.

J	Sung, YH				Sung, Yun-Hee			Awareness about the necessity of vestibular rehabilitation education in Korean physical therapists	JOURNAL OF EXERCISE REHABILITATION			English	Article						Vestibular rehabilitation; Education; Physical therapist	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; COMPENSATION	Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) improves dizziness and vertigo, postural control, and quality of life. It is a beneficial and safe intervention for patients with peripheral vestibular disease. Physical therapists play an important role in treating them, but Korean physical therapists have little experience in VR or treating peripheral vestibular disease. Furthermore, there are few studies on the current status of Korean physical therapists regarding VR. Therefore, we aimed to identify the awareness and current status of Korean physical therapists regarding VR and to discuss the necessity of VR education. The data were obtained from an online survey conducted among 483 licensed physical therapists. In total, 393 questionnaires were analyzed, after excluding 90 questionnaires (18.6%) with poor answers. Most physical therapists had no VR education (75.6%) and had a high positive response for the necessity of VR education (68.2%) and intention to receive VR education (63.9%). There was a significant difference in clinical experience and intention to receive VR education (P<0.05) with respect to presence or absence of VR education. For the necessity of VR education, there was a statistically significant difference in academic background, institutional type, and intention to receive VR education (P<0.05). In conclusion, many physical therapists in Korea are very interested in VR education, and various factors have highlighted the need for VR education. Therefore, professional education for VR and the cooperation and attention of related medical staff are urgently required.

Age-related differences to neck muscle activation latency as a potential risk factor to fall-related traumatic brain injuries	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injuries; Aging; Accidental falls; Neck muscles	ELDERLY SUBJECTS; HEAD; RESPONSES; COORDINATION; BIOMECHANICS; IMPROVES	This investigation examined age-related differences in neck muscle activation latency in response to anterior and posterior postural perturbations to understand the potential implications in fall-related traumatic brain injuries. 57 adults were recruited and categorized into 3 groups based on age: Young (18-30 years old), Young-Old (60- 74 years) and Old-Old (75-89 years) group. Study participants underwent six anterior and posterior postural perturbations while bilateral sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius, and splenius capitis electromyography was collected. Muscle activation latency time was calculated with established procedures. During anterior translations, a significant group effect for muscle activation latency of the right SCM (F(2,43) = 8.786, p < 0.001), right (F(2,34) = 4.838, p = 0.014) and left (F(2,34) = 5.015, p = 0.012) upper trapezius, and right (F (2,45) = 3.195, p = 0.050) and left (F(2,45) = 3.819, p = 0.029) splenius capitis was observed. During posterior translations, a significant group effect for muscle activation latency was observed in the right (F (2,34) = 6.419, p = 0.004) and left (F(2,41) = 5.275, p = 0.009) SCM, and the right (F(2,34) = 4.925, p = 0.013) and left (F(2,32) = 4.055, p = 0.027) upper trapezius. Both older groups displayed longer muscle activation latencies than the young group. The age-related differences in neck muscle activation latency may be placing older adults at a greater risk of fall-related traumatic brain injuries.

This information is needed to en-able clinical workers to evaluate and provide training for attention deficits in patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: In-patient and community recruitment. Participants: In-patients with mild traumatic brain injury (n = 44) and community-recruited healthy subjects (n = 45). Outcome measures: All participants used a battery of attention tests including the Digit Span Test (DST), Digit Cancellation Test (D-CAT1 and D-CAT2), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). Results: There were no differences in the results of the D-CAT between the patient and control groups (p > 0.05); however, there were significant differences in the DST, SDMT and PASAT (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Patients with mild traumatic brain injury were found to have normal sustained attention and selective attention, but impaired attention span, divided attention, shifting attention and information processing speed, requiring clinical workers to focus more on these deficits.

J	Yamaki, T; Oka, N; Odaki, M; Kobayashi, S				Yamaki, Tomohiro; Oka, Nobuo; Odaki, Masaru; Kobayashi, Shigeki			Usability of intravenous thiamine injection test compared with odor stick identification test for Japanese patients with severe traumatic brain injury	AURIS NASUS LARYNX			English	Article						Olfactory dysfunction; Intravenous thiamine injection; OSIT-J; Traumatic brain injury; Traumatic smell dysfunction	HEAD-INJURY; IMPAIRMENT; OLFACTION	Objective: Olfactory dysfunction is often observed after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Its diagnosis is difficult because patients with sTBI have a communication disability following impaired consciousness and communication disorder. The intravenous thiamine injection (IT) test is one of the representative diagnostic examinations to identify dysfunction, and it is often used in medical certification for liability insurance of automobiles in Japan because it could be judged by a simple reaction. However, the extent of usefulness of the IT test in the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction in patients with sTBI is unknown. In this study, we validated the usability of the IT test and compared the results with those of the odor stick identification test for the Japanese (OSIT-J) to evaluate the sensitivity of the IT test in patients with sTBI. Methods: The study enrolled 205 subjects, including 10 healthy volunteers and 195 patients with sTBI. First, we examined olfactory dysfunction in sTBI patients using OSIT-J. Subsequently, we performed the IT test among patients with olfactory dysfunction. Results: In the first part, 41 subjects, including 10 healthy volunteers, were examined by using the OSIT-J test. As a result, 28 patients were diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction (90.3%, p < 0.0001), including anosmia and parosmia, compared with healthy volunteers. Among the 12 odors, garlic odor was easily recognized for patients with olfactory dysfunction. As a consequence of the IT test for 11 patients with olfactory dysfunction, four patients recognized thiamine odor, and seven patients did not. All four patients could recognize the garlic odor of OSIT-J, but 2 of the seven patients could recognize the garlic odor of OSIT-J, suggesting that the thiamine odor is linked to garlic odor (p = 0.046), but not always. The detection rate of olfactory dysfunction through the IT test was 36.4%. Conclusion: Our data showed that garlic odor, which is similar to thiamine odor, was easily recognizable for patients with sTBI. However, the IT test might overlook the diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction because it only identifies one odor. In addition, thiamine frequently induces angialgia. We should pay attention to the overconfidence of the IT test for patients with sTBI. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of concerns of worsening intracranial hemorrhage, clinicians are hesitant to start VTE chemoprophylaxis in this population. We hypothesized that ACS Level I trauma centers would be more aggressive with VTE chemoprophylaxis in adults with severe TBI than Level II centers. We also predicted that Level I centers would have a lower risk of VTE. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010-2016) database for patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of 4 and 5 of the head and compared them based on treating the hospital trauma level. Of 204,895 patients with severe TBI, 143,818 (70.2%) were treated at Level I centers and 61,077 (29.8%) at Level II centers. The Level I cohort had a higher rate of VTE chemoprophylaxis use (43.2% vs 23.3%, P < 0.001) and a shorter median time to chemoprophylaxis (61.9 vs 85.9 hours, P < 0.001). Although Level I trauma centers started VTE chemoprophylaxis more often and earlier than Level II centers, there was no difference in the risk of VTE (P = 0.414) after controlling for covariates. Future prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the timing, safety, and efficacy of early VTE chemoprophylaxis in severe TBI patients.

Novel antioxidant nitroxides have been shown to mimic MnSOD to ameliorate oxidative stress related disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two nitroxides, CTMIO and DCTEIO, on the neurological outcomes following moderate TBI in rats induced by a weight drop device. The rats were immediately treated with CTMIO and DCTEIO (40 mM in drinking water) post-injury for up to 2 weeks. The brains were histologically examined at 24 h and 6 weeks post injury. DCTEIO reduced the lesion size at both 24h and 6 weeks, with normalised performance in sensory, motor and cognitive tests at 24h post-injury. Astrogliosis was heightened by DCTEIO at 24h and still elevated at 6 weeks in this group. In TBI brains, cellular damage was evident as reflected by changes in markers of mitophagy and autophagy (increased fission marker dynamin-related protein (Drp)-1, and autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3)A/B and reduced fusion marker optic atrophy (Opa)-1). These were normalised by DCTEIO treatment. CTMIO, on the other hand, seems to be toxic to the injured brains, by increasing injury size at 6 weeks. In conclusion, DCTEIO significantly improved tissue repair and preserved neurological function in rats with TBI possibly via a mitophagy mechanism. This study provides evidence for DCTEIO as a promising new option to alleviate lesion severity after moderate TBI, which is not actively treated.

RO27-3225 is a highly selective melanocortin receptor 4 agonist that alleviates damage in many nervous system diseases, such as cerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effect of RO27-3225 on cerebral infarction remains unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and administered RO27-3225 or saline to the mice through intraperitoneal injection. RO27-3225 increased the number of Nestin(+)/BrdU(+) cells and doublecortin (DCX)(+)/BrdU(+) cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the number of DCX+/BrdU(+) cells in the peri-infarct area on day 7 after tMCAO. Furthermore, RO27-3225 decreased the number of activated microglia (Iba1(+) cells with a specific morphology) and the expression levels of Iba1, TNF alpha, IL6, and iNOS proteins and increased the number of PDGFR beta(+) cells in the peri-infarct region on day 3 after tMCAO. Finally, RO27-3225-treated mice exhibited significantly decreased infarct volumes, brain water contents, and neurological deficits after cerebral infarction. Thus, RO27-3225 can improve the outcomes following cerebral infarction, partially by regulating neurogenesis in the SVZ, PDGFR beta(+) cell survival and neuroinflammation in the peri-infarct zone. Our research reveals that RO27-3225 is a potential new treatment for cerebral infarction.

A commitment to the length of play in advance, as in the case of long-term contracts, led to a greater chance of staying beyond the expected payoff-maximizing point. If the decision frame is altered so that decisions are made in each period rather than through an upfront commitment, the magnitude of potential losses is more evident.

Critical methodological considerations in recruiting and engaging non-native English speaking workers with a head injury: a Canadian perspective	BMC RESEARCH NOTES			English	Article						Methodological considerations; Traumatic brain injury; Qualitative; Interviews; Head injury; Occupational injury	BRAIN-INJURY; HEALTH	Objective Non-native English speaking workers with a mild work-related traumatic brain and/or head injury are a vulnerable and underrepresented population in research studies. The researchers present their experiences with recruiting and performing qualitative interviews with non-native English speaking individuals with a work-related mild traumatic brain injury, and provide recommendations on how to better include this vulnerable population in future research studies. This paper presents considerations regarding ethics, recruitment challenges, interview preparation and debriefing, sex & gender and language and cultural issues must be made when working with this vulnerable population. Results The researchers discuss critical issues and provide recommendations in recruiting and engaging with non-native English language workers including ethics, recruitment challenges, interview preparation and debriefing, sex & gender and language, and cultural considerations that must be made when working with this population. The study recommendations advise investigators to spend more time to learn about the non-native English participants in the mild wrTBI context, to be familiar with the vulnerabilities and specific circumstances that these workers experience.

However, numerous reports indicate the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapy in stroke rehabilitation. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of integrated TCM (Wendan decoction [WDD]) in patients with acute brain injury as a combination therapy in the early stages. Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial. Setting: Single-center study. Subjects: Sixty patients diagnosed with acute brain injury were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups, equally, and 41 patients completed the study. Interventions: All patients were treated by conventional neurologic intensive care. The 23 patients in the intervention group were administered with an integrated WDD in the early stages three times daily; combination treatment was initiated within 14 days and lasted >1 month. Outcome measures: Duration of ventilator use, intensive care unit stays, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, motor response, the best muscle power, disability rating scale (DRS) scores, modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores, and the mortality rate for the first month. The other outcome measures were GCS scores, motor response, the best muscle power, DRS, mRS, and Barthel index (BI) scores 6 months later. Results: There was no mortality in the intervention group, but the rate was 39% in the control group for first month. Comparisons between groups showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in GCS, DRS, mRS, and BI scores, indicating improvements in the intervention group after 6 months. Conclusions: In the early stages of acute brain injury, combination treatment with WDD was found to be safe. Furthermore, this treatment may improve neurologic functional outcomes after 6 months.

Manual medicine in posttraumatic organic psychosyndrome	MANUELLE MEDIZIN			German	Article						Craniocerebral trauma; Spinal injuries; Psychological factors; Manual therapies; Cervical atlas		The case of a 17-year-old schoolgirl who suffered a traumatic brain injury with fracture of the petrous bone and a soft tissue injury to the upper cervical spine in a car accident is described. As a result of the accident, headache, dizziness, and attention and concentration disorders occurred, followed later by panic attacks, sleep disorders and nightmares. The symptoms were diagnosed as an organic brain psychosyndrome and psychotherapy was initiated. Due to the persistent headache and dizziness, a manual medical examination was carried out 2 months after the accident, in which a complex cervico-occipital dysfunction was identified and treated. Immediately afterwards there was an impressive improvement in the somatic and psychological symptoms.

J	Vassallo, S; Douglas, J				Vassallo, Suzane; Douglas, Jacinta			A novel combined visual scanning and verbal cuing intervention improves facial affect recognition after chronic severe traumatic brain injury: A single case design	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Facial affect recognition; Single case design; Traumatic brain injury; Response times; Emotion	EMOTION RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; DEFICITS; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; FACE; COMMUNICATION; MEMORY; ADULTS; REHABILITATION	A single case design (AB with follow up) was used to determine the effect of a combined visual scanning and verbal cuing intervention technique in improving facial affect recognition after traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 35-year-old male (BR) with impaired ability to recognize facial emotions as a result of severe TBI participated in the study over a 3-month duration. BR's mean accuracy across six universal static facial expressions of emotion improved significantly during intervention and was maintained at follow up. BR was most impaired in labelling negative (sad, angry, disgusted, anxious) versus positive facial expressions (surprised, happy). BR's accuracy to negative facial affect significantly improved during intervention. No further improvement was possible for positive expressions because a ceiling effect was observed at baseline. Overall BR's mean response times across emotions was reduced at baseline but increased significantly during intervention. This was also recorded for both positive and negative expressions, respectively. This novel combined intervention has potential to improve facial affect recognition after TBI. Further evaluation using a multiple-baseline design is recommended. Additional research is needed to determine whether improved facial affect recognition following training translates to improvements in social function and communication in people with TBI.

Many have advocated for cognitive baselines; however, there is no uniform practice of neuropsychological baseline testing at the collegiate level leading to variance in administration and interpretation. Continuing clarification on best practices is essential for the field, especially considering previous research highlighting normal variability on cognitive tests in other populations, but also the need for separate normative sources for those with attention and learning problems. This study aimed to evaluate the range of normal variability in a diverse sample of collegiate athletes administered a traditional neuropsychological baseline. Method: Neuropsychological baseline measures were collected on 236 Division 1 University student athletes over 4 years. Frequency of scores that fell at 1, 1.5, and 2 or greater standard deviations were reviewed. Student athletes were further evaluated for likelihood of factors which could impact results (i.e. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], Specific Learning Disorder [SLD], and psychiatric distress). Results: The results demonstrated high rates of variability in most test scores for the collective sample. Student athletes at risk for ADHD, SLD, and/or psychiatric distress appeared to demonstrate a higher degree of variability relative to individuals with minimal risk. Conclusion: Baseline evaluation data revealed the presence of normal variability in a student athlete population. Left unrecognized, this can lead to errors in clinical recommendations given the nature of concussion. Certain individuals have risk factors which may increase the range of variability, and this should be explored further in future research.	[Fallows, Robert R.; Mullane, Audrina; Watts, Ashley K.

Serum Neurosteroid Levels Are Associated With Cortical Thickness in Individuals Diagnosed With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and History of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical thickness; mild traumatic brain injury; neurosteroids; posttraumatic stress disorder	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; GABA-A RECEPTOR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICOSTERONE SECRETION; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; COMBAT VETERANS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SEX-DIFFERENCES	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) co-occurring with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in veterans. Worse clinical outcome in those with PTSD has been associated with decreased serum neurosteroid levels. Furthermore, decreased cortical thickness has been associated with both PTSD and mTBI. However, it is not known whether decreased neurosteroids are associated with decreased cortical thickness in PTSD co-occurring with mTBI. This study included 141 individuals divided into the following groups: (a) mTBI group (n = 32 [10 female, 22 male] veterans with a history of mTBI); (b) PTSD + mTBI group (n = 41 [6 female, 35 male] veterans with current PTSD with a history of mTBI); and (c) control group (n = 68 [35 female, 33 male] control participants), which were acquired through the Injury and Traumatic Stress (INTRuST) Clinical Consortium. Subjects underwent clinical assessment, magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, and serum neurosteroid quantifications of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnenolone (PREGN). Group differences in cortical thickness and associations between serum neurosteroid levels and cortical thickness were investigated. Cortical thickness was decreased in the PTSD + mTBI group compared with the other groups. In the PTSD + mTBI group, decreased cortical thickness was also associated with lower serum ALLO (right superior frontal cortex) and lower serum PREGN (left middle temporal and right orbitofrontal cortex). Cortical thickness in the middle temporal and orbitofrontal cortex was associated with PTSD symptom severity. There were no significant associations between neurosteroids and cortical thickness in the mTBI or control groups. Decreased cortical thickness in individuals with PTSD + mTBI is associated with decreased serum neurosteroid levels and greater PTSD symptom severity. Causality is unclear. However, future studies might investigate whether treatment with neurosteroids could counteract stress-induced neural atrophy in PTSD + mTBI by potentially preserving cortical thickness.

J	Kato, A				Kato, Akihito			Atmospheric impregnation behavior of calcium phosphate materials for antibiotic therapy in neurotrauma surgery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POROUS HYDROXYAPATITE; CERAMICS; BLOCKS	As part of a verification model of antibiotic therapy in cranioplasty, we evaluated the impregnation efficiency of interporous calcium phosphate materials with saline under atmospheric pressure and compared it to the efficiency of using the decompression method established by the Japanese Industrial Standard, under which pressure is reduced by 10 kPa. Five types of material formed in 1 mL cubes were selected as test samples: two consisting of hydroxyapatite (HAp) with 85% and 55% porosity and three of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) with 75%, 67%, and 57% porosity. All test samples showed an impregnation ratio of more than 70%, except for the HAp sample with 55% porosity, which had a ratio of approximately 50%. These high ratios were achieved at only 15 min. The impregnation effects were likely dependent on porosity and were independent of base material, either HAp or beta-TCP. Obtaining sufficient impregnation and antimicrobial efficacy in materials with low porosity, which are commonly used in cranioplasty, would require an increased volume of antibiotics rather than increased duration of impregnation. Our findings will enable the simple preparation of drug-impregnated calcium phosphate materials, even in operating rooms not equipped with a large decompression device.

J	Holland, M; Norman, C				Holland, Marie; Norman, Christine			Differences between staff groups in perception of risk assessment and risk management of inappropriate sexual behaviour in patients with traumatic brain injury	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Inappropriate sexual behaviour; Risk assessment; Risk management	CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; ATTRIBUTIONS; ADULTS; MEN; PREVALENCE; RESPONSES; DEMENTIA; SERVICE; PEOPLE	This research explored staff perceptions of risk assessment and management of inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB) displayed in patients following a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The primary focus was to determine differences in perceptions between qualified (N = 40) and direct care staff (N = 47). Vignettes depicting ISB displayed by a male following a TBI were rated. The vignettes varied in behaviour (intimate versus non-contact) and age of the victim (child versus adult). Ratings for causal explanations (poor management, attention seeking, negative emotion and education), attributions (need for action and increase awareness) and emotions were analysed alongside risk assessment and management variables. Intimate contact ISB and ISB directed towards a child were perceived to be more serious and in need of intervention. Direct care staff perceived ISB to be due to sexual motivations, poor emotion control and to seek attention. They elicited greater negative emotions and based their judgements of risk on seriousness. On the other hand, qualified staff were more concerned about implementing interventions based on the risk of recurrence. Differences between staff groups could cause conflict regarding the assessment and management of ISB in TBI. Training to increase awareness of the behaviour could minimise differences and produce greater cohesion within clinical practise.

The Building Bridges project: Linking disconnected service networks in acquired brain injury and criminal justice	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Acquired brain injury; Traumatic brain injury; Cognitive impairment; Prisoner; Justice reinvestment; Criminal justice; Training	CROSS-SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; HEAD-INJURY; PREVALENCE; PRISON; BEHAVIOR; REHABILITATION; OPPORTUNITIES; POPULATION; DISABILITY	People with acquired brain injury (ABI) are overrepresented in prison populations across many countries. An effective service response to reduce this trend requires collaboration between the ABI and criminal justice (CJ) sectors. The Building Bridges project piloted a novel professional development model designed to increase cross-sectoral knowledge and collaboration between the ABI and CJ sectors. A total of 178 service providers from Victoria, Australia, participated in six professional development forums that included content about ABI, policing, disability and legal supports, and correctional/post-release services. Participants came from the disability, criminal justice, and health and community service sectors. Using a pre-test-post-test design with 6-month follow-up, data were obtained via a project-specific questionnaire evaluating knowledge and behaviour change among participants. Statistically significant gains in knowledge were shown at post-test and maintained at follow-up. Work-related behaviours addressing ABI/CJ issues had increased significantly within both sectors at follow-up compared to the 6 months prior to the forum. Carefully constructed professional forums improved cross-silo collaboration in the ABI/CJ sectors. This pilot project illustrates effective use of existing service resources, and highlights training as an important part of a raft of initiatives needed to address the overrepresentation of people with ABI in the CJ system.

The aim of this study is to evaluate accommodation, stereopsis deficits and visual symptoms in Chinese patients with traumatic brain injury. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that included 22 patients with traumatic brain injury and 22 controls; the refractive status, stereoacuity, and accommodative ability of each subject were measured. Results Patients with traumatic brain injury were significantly more symptomatic than controls (p < 0.001). Near stereoacuity thresholds were significantly elevated in patients with traumatic brain injury compared to controls (p<0.001). Accommodative amplitude (right eye: p = 0.007; left eye: p = 0.01; both eyes: p = 0.002) and accommodative facility rates (right eye: p<0.001; left eye: p<0.001; both eyes: p<0.001) were significantly lower in patients with traumatic brain injury, for whom there were no significant differences between the accommodative facility rates of the pre- and post-three-minute binocular flipper sessions (p = 0.51). Patients with traumatic brain injury showed greater accommodative lag to 2.5 D (p = 0.03), 3 D (p = 0.03), 4 D (p = 0.004) and 5 D (p = 0.001) stimuli, but not to the 2 D (p = 0.10) stimulus. The regression equation of accommodative lag to stimuli was steeper for the traumatic brain injury group (slope: p = 0.01; y-intercept: p<0.0001). There were also significant correlations between visual symptoms and clinical findings including binocular accommodative amplitude (r = -0.480, p = 0.001), binocular accommodative facility (r = -0.445,p = 0.004) and stereopsis (r = 0.457, p = 0.002). Conclusion Patients with traumatic brain injury have deficits in accommodation and stereopsis.

A lumbar puncture revealed raised ICP and a careful CSF withdrawal was performed, resulting in an immediate neurological improvement, confirming the diagnosis of EH. During the 20-month follow-up, the patient presented progressive signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): gait and cognitive decline, ventriculomegaly and the lumbar infusion study confirmed disturbed CSF dynamics. The patient underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery, resulting in a long-lasting improvement.

The peptide was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 1 mg/kg in 3 h and on days 2, 3, 4, 5 after injury. We evaluated morphometric parameters of the epithelial cells of the tongue, small intestine, and liver cells (AgNOR staining), neuronal layers II and V of the neocortex of the parietal lobe and hippocampal CA1 field (staining with gallocyanin) were evaluated in the post-traumatic period. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was induced in rats by using the impact model (WDM; weight drop method). MGHPPGP peptide corrected the activity indicators of the nuclear organizer regions in epitheliocytes of the tongue.	[Fleishman, M. Yu.; Yakusheva, N. Yu.; Malofey, Yu. B.; Tolstenok, I.

Medico-legal evaluation and trend of the different patterns of maxillofacial fractures concomitant with closed head injury in Upper Egypt: retrospective study	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Medico-legal; Maxillofacial; Fractures; Closed head injury; Trend; Egypt	TRAUMA; 5-YEAR	Background Maxillofacial fractures are of great medico-legal implications because they are of common occurrence with other injuries, predominantly head injuries that might involve serious esthetic and functional problems, and so clinically described as consequential injuries. The aims were to assess the medico-legal aspects of maxillofacial fractured cases concomitant with closed head injury over a 6-year period (2011-2016) in the Trauma Unit of Assiut University Hospitals, Egypt, and to evaluate the demographic feature and the trend of different patterns of such fractures. Patient and methods A descriptive hospital-based study included all cases of maxillofacial fractures combined with closed head injury attending the Trauma Unit of Assiut University Hospitals in the period of January 2011 to December 2016. Results The study included 1221 cases, the percent of maxillofacial fractures with a closed head injury was 4%, the age group 18-40 years was having the highest incidence, and mean age was 25.9 +/- 15.3 years with male to female ratio of 7:1. Road traffic accidents were the main etiology of injury (69.7%), followed by falls (15.1%) and violent assaults (10.2%) while firearm injuries were the last (5%). Unintentional injuries were the commonest in 83.1% followed by homicidal (16.3%); only 7 cases were due to suicidal attacks. The mandibular fracture was the commonest (49.7%) followed by fracture maxilla (19.2%), fracture zygoma (16.8%), and lastly frontal bone and nasal fracture. The trend of maxillofacial fractures over the 6-year period tended to be increased with the highest number in 2011 (21.5%) and the lowest in 2014 (13.3%). Conclusion Maxillofacial fracture with a closed head injury in Upper Egypt is common in the middle age with male predominance. Road traffic accident is the main etiologic factor, and accidental trauma is the commonest manner. Mandibular fractures are the commonest pattern followed by fracture maxilla. Traumatic head injuries in cases of maxillofacial fractures were mild in about half of the cases. The trend of maxillofacial fractures over the 6-year period of the study (2011-2016) tended to be increased with the highest number in 2011 and the lowest in 2014.

Osteogenesis can also be influenced by the timing of fracture stabilization. We aimed to identify how chest injuries, TBI and fracture stabilization strategy influences the incidence of non-union. Methods Patients with long bone fractures of the lower extremities who had been treated between 2004 and 2014 were retrospectively analysed. Non-union was defined as fracture healing not occurring in the expected time period and in which neither progression of healing nor successful union is expected without intervention. Diverse clinical and radiological parameters were statistically analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results The total number of operations before consolidation was an independent predictor (odds ratio [OR] = 6.416, p < 0.001) for the development of non-union in patients with long bone fractures. More specifically, patients treated according to the damage control orthopaedics (DCO) principle had a significantly higher risk of developing a non-union than patients treated according to the early total care (ETC) principle (OR = 7.878, p = 0.005). Concomitant chest injury and TBI could not be identified as influencing factors for non-union development. Conclusion Our results indicate that the number of operations performed in patients with long bone fractures should be kept as low as possible and that the indication for and the timing of DCO treatment should be meticulously noted to minimize the risk of non-union development.

Psychometric properties of the standardized assessment of concussion in youth football: Validity, reliability, and demographic factors	APPLIED NEUROPSYCHOLOGY-CHILD			English	Article						Construct validity; demographic factors; standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC); test-retest reliability; youth football	EDUCATION; RECOVERY	The objective of this study was to determine the psychometrics (reliability, validity) of the original Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) in a youth sample (ages 11 to 13). Demographic factors of race, level of vocabulary knowledge, mother's level of education were also considered. Over 150 youth football athletes completed the SAC and a brief battery of NIH Toolbox cognitive tests as part of a larger study on biomechanical factors in youth sport concussion. This was a within-subjects design (pre-season, post-season assessments), and correlational analysis of convergent and discriminant validity. Between groups analysis based on demographic differences was also employed. The pre-season SAC scores were not different by age; however, SAC scores were statistically different by race: t(155) = 3.162, p = .002, d = .519. Maternal level of education and participant vocabulary scores were related to racial group membership. Convergent and discriminant validity were established compared to NIH Toolbox tests of memory and speed. Pre-post-season tests for 108 participants established marginally acceptable test-retest reliability (ICC = .692). These data support the use of the original SAC in youth football although clinicians must be aware of racial differences in scores.

Case report: We present the case of a 66-year-old man who developed coma with subsequent DOC after a severe traumatic brain injury. Behavioural assessment constitutes the gold standard in the evaluation of patients with DOC. In the case presented herein the neuropsychological findings were ambiguous, and the patient underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether he was in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Three paradigms: passive, active, and resting state fMRI were used to study the brain activity in our patient. Conclusions: fMRI provided reliable evidence of preserved minimal consciousness. The neuroimaging techniques used in our patient were vital for his further treatment.

J	Koko, AM; Lasseini, A				Koko, Aliyu Muhammad; Lasseini, Ali			Impalement brain injury: report of five consecutive clinical cases	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Impalement injury; Traumatic brain injury; Outcome		Background The management of impalement brain injury is very challenging, because of its complexity, risk of intracranial infection, neurological damage and functional impairment of the affected persons; in addition to the paucity of standardised treatments guidelines. The objective of this paper was to describe the clinical presentation and management outcome of patients admitted with impalement brain injuries in our centre. Case presentation Data of all patients with traumatic brain injury from January 2015 to November 2018 was collated from hospital medical record department and theatre operation register. Records of patients with impalement brain injury managed within the aforementioned period were extracted. We managed 5 cases (0.26%) of impalement cranio-cerebral injuries out of the total 1913 cases of traumatic brain injury managed over the study period. All the patients were males with a mean age of 28 years. Alteration in the level of consciousness and bleeding scalp wound with impaled object were the main presenting symptoms. Three of the patients were presented in coma. The injury resulted from different causes and variable objects implicated. The impaled objects identified included iron-rod, metallic part of Dane gun, multi-faceted spear, piece of stone and a piece of charred wood. Both the right and left sides of the cranium was equally affected with a case involving midline frontal area. Craniectomy around the impaled object was used to remove the objects, two patients had good recovery whilst three succumbed to the injuries, one died from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and the two were from aspiration pneumonitis complicated by respiratory failure. Conclusions Impalement cranio-cerebral injury accounted for about 0.3% of all cases of traumatic brain injury in our environment. Variable impaled objects were found affecting a different part of the cranium and postoperative outcome depends largely on the preoperative neurological status.

J	Koebli, JR; Balasubramanian, V; Zipp, GP				Koebli, Judith R.; Balasubramanian, Venugopal; Zipp, Genevieve Pinto			An exploration of higher-level language comprehension deficits and factors influencing them following blast TBI in US veterans	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Blast traumatic brain injury; blast exposure; inferencing; auditory processing disorder; ambiguity	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DUAL SENSORY IMPAIRMENT; MTBI; REHABILITATION; EXPOSURE; PERFORMANCE; DYSFUNCTION; PERCEPTION; HEARING	Primary Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors that might have a negative influence on auditory processing and higher-level language processing in the US veterans of the recent foreign wars (Iraq and Afghanistan). Research Design. Exploratory, cross-sectional, correlational, prospective, cohort-design. Methods and Procedures. The experimental group consisted of 12 US veterans of war (10 males and 2 females) with blast exposure. The control group consisted of six US veterans (5 males and 1 female) without the history of blast exposure. Both groups were matched in mean age. Both groups were tested on Boston Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury, Consonant Trigrams Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, Trail Making Test, SCAN-3, CELF-5-Metalinguistics, CASL, and an unpublished test on the processing of sentence prosody. Main Outcomes and Results. Significant group differences in attention, and time-compressed sentence processing were found. For those veterans (in the experimental group) who were not wearing their helmets at the time of blast, additional significant differences were noted with inferencing and auditory figure-ground tasks. Conclusions: Findings support the importance of including speech/language pathologists in all stages of recovery for veterans post-blast exposure.

J	Abe, T				Abe, Tezira			THE NCAA's SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENT-ATHLETES AS A THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR CONCUSSION-RELATED INJURIES	MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW			English	Article								The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the primary governing body of college athletics. Although the NCAA proclaims to protect student-athletes, an examination of its practices suggests that the organization has a troubling history of ignoring the harmful effects of concussions. Over one hundred years after the NCAA was established, and seventy years after the NCAA itself knew of the potential effects of concussions, the organization has done little to reduce the occurrence of concussions or to alleviate the potential effects that stem from repeated hits to the head. This Note argues for recognizing a special relationship between the NCAA and student-athletes that would allow these athletes to hold the NCAA liable for concussion-related injuries.

Thus, monitoring of intracranial pressure becomes a necessity in many traumatic and non-traumatic brain lesions. Potential lesions. Potential risks and complications of monitoring include bleeding, bacterial infections, and injury due to probe misplacement. Objective: to identify and assess the complications related to intraparenchymal transducer intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring at King Saud Medical City (KSMC) in Riyadh, KSA. Design: This is a retrospective cohort study. Setting: the neurosurgery department at King Saud Medical (KSMC). Patients (Materials) and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study, which was performed from January 2016 until December 2018. Patients were recruited from the neurosurgery department at King Saud Medical City (KSMC). The patients were 14 years of age and older and used an intraparenchymal transducer ICP monitoring device during their admission. The collection sheet covered the following topics: socio-demographic variables, age at admission, gender, chronic diseases, indications, CT diagnosis and complications associated with intraparenchymal transducer ICP monitoring devices, GCS score at admission and discharge, and whether there Main Outcome Measures: complication rates due to ICP transducer monitoring. Sample size: 106 patients. Results: A total of 88.7% of patients did not have any complications. However, at the surgical site of intraparenchymal ICP monitoring insertion, 7.5% of patients developed wound infections, 1.9% of patients developed leakage, and 0.9% of patients developed both wound infections and leakage. Conclusion: The complication rates due to ICP transducer monitoring were low. Specifically, 88.7% of the patients did not have any complication, whereas 10.3% of the patients showed minor complications without serious consequences. These complications were treated immediately after they were diagnosed.

J	Anderson, D; Kutsogiannis, DJ; Sligl, WI				Anderson, Dustin; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J.; Sligl, Wendy, I			Sepsis in Traumatic Brain Injury: Epidemiology and Outcomes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Sepsis; Infection; Traumatic brain injury; Outcomes	RISK; CLASSIFICATION; POPULATION	Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality include older age, co-morbidity, and TBI severity. Few studies have investigated the role of sepsis in individuals with TBI. Methods: We studied adult patients with TBI admitted to intensive care over a 5-year period. Patient characteristics were identified by linking clinical and administrative databases. Charts of individuals with TBI and sepsis were manually reviewed. Predictors of ICU and hospital mortality were identified using logistic regression modeling. Results: Four hundred eighty-six individuals with TBI were admitted to intensive care. Sixteen (3.3%) developed sepsis. Pneumonia was the most common source (94%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (75%). ICU lengths of stay (LOS) (12.2 days [interquartile range (IQR) 4.4-23.5] versus 3.7 days [IQR 1.7-8.2]; p < 0.001) and hospital LOS (28.0 days [IQR 11.8-41.4] versus 15.3 days [IQR 5.0-30.9]; p = 0.017) were longer in patients with TBI and sepsis. Sepsis was not associated with ICU (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.51; 95%CI 0.12-2.27; p = 0.38) or hospital (aOR 0.78; 95% CI 0.21-2.96; p = 0.78) mortality, though age (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.04; p = 0.014 for hospital mortality), severe TBI (aOR 3.71; 95% CI 1.52-9.08; p = 0.004 for ICU mortality and 4.10; 95% CI 1.95-8.65; p < 0.001 for hospital mortality), and APACHE II score (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.28; p < 0.001 for ICU mortality and 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31; p < 0.001 for hospital mortality) were. Conclusion: Sepsis in patients with TBI was not associated with mortality; however, sepsis was associated with increased health care utilization (ICU and hospital LOS).

It highlights several areas where data is sparse that might spark the interest of researchers. It proposes a broad guideline for managing patients who present for surgery. Recent Findings The post-concussive brain has a vulnerable window of risk in which secondary insult might worsen long-term outcome. Scheduling elective surgery beyond this window of vulnerability might be beneficial. Several biomarkers may prove to be helpful in determining the timing of elective surgery and in risk stratification for the patient undergoing urgent or emergent surgery. Summary Mild traumatic brain injury is common. Patients often present in the acute care setting for surgical procedures unrelated to their head injury. The care of these patients may influence the natural history of their intracranial pathology and may impact long-term outcomes. In this review, we provide a brief synopsis of the pathophysiology of this disease. We discuss potential anesthetic interactions, offer broad guidelines for anesthetic management based on available data, and suggest areas of future research.

Materials and Methods: Data from 60 traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients were collected. Moving averaging and FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filtering were performed on the ABP(t) and ICP(t) signals, and the PRx was estimated from both filtered datasets. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the area under the curves (AUCs) were determined using patient outcomes as a reference. The outcome chosen for comparison among the two filtering methods were mortality and survival. Results: The FIR filtering approach, compared with clinical outcome, had a sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 81%, and a level of significance p = 0.001 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. The moving average filtering method compared with the clinical outcome had a sensitivity of 58%, a specificity of 72%, and a level of significance p = 0.054, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66. Conclusions: The FIR (optimal) filtering approach was found to be more sensitive for discriminating between two clinical outcomes, namely intact (survival) and impaired (death) cerebral autoregulation for TBI treatment decision making.

Designing a Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration to Reduce Overuse of Neuroimaging for Minor Head Injury and Atraumatic Headache	CLINICAL PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						child; quality of health care; brain injuries; traumatic; headache; neuroimaging	CHILDREN; IMPROVEMENT; SCANS	Despite recommendations to limit the use of neuroimaging for evaluation of minor head injury and atraumatic headache in children, many children receive unnecessary imaging without clear history or physical exam indications in the emergency department (ED) or other outpatient settings. This overuse of neuroimaging has not previously been explored across clinical settings, nor for the diagnosis of atraumatic headache. We convened a multi-stakeholder design meeting to discuss reasons for overuse of neuroimaging in children and brainstorm potential interventions to reduce overuse. The meeting included didactic sessions on the risks and benefits of neuroimaging and quality improvement methodology. There were also small group discussions of challenges and potential interventions. Participants included ED physicians and nurses, radiologists, Medicaid health plan representatives, a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric primary care provider and a parent. Reasons for overuse included family anxiety and expectations for neuroimaging, pediatric phone triage protocols directing patients to the ED for evaluation, time pressures within primary care and the ED clinics, and reluctance among payers to institute prior authorization for ED-based imaging studies. Several potential interventions were identified and organized into three key driver diagrams: one each for primary care, the ED, and Medicaid health plans. Convening a multi-stakeholder meeting was feasible and resulted in the identification of common reasons for overuse of neuroimaging in children and many potential interventions across clinical settings. Similar multidisciplinary approaches may be helpful for others interested in reducing the overuse of imaging in children. Discussions from a multi-stakeholder meeting with representation from primary care, pediatric emergency departments, and Medicaid health plans resulted in the identification of common reasons for overuse of neuroimaging in children and many potential interventions across clinical settings.

Methods: a retrospective study through the analysis of medical records of 105 motorcycle accident victims in Campinas (SP) attended in a university hospital of reference and who needed surgical procedure in 2017. Results: 87 patients (82.9%) were men. Multiple fractures were observed in 61 patients (58.1%) and polytrauma was found in 14 patients (13.3%). Tibial fracture was the most frequent, present in 65 cases (61.9%). Exposed fractures occurred in 68 patients (64.7%). Among the polytrauma victims, the most frequent injury was traumatic brain injury (TBI), present in seven patients (6.6%). The mean age was 29.8 years (range 6-63 years). The average length of hospital stay was 14 days (1-87). Conclusion: It is essential to investigate and evaluate the victims' epidemiological profile, as well as the resulting injuries, in order to provide adequate support for the implementation of measures aimed at primary prevention and awareness of the most affected groups.

The aim of this study was to determine the importance of ICG in the context of medico-legal opinions. We assessed 159 cases of trauma-induced death. Cadavers with pronounced signs of decomposition, open skull fractures, and after neurosurgical operations were excluded. Both PMCT findings and data from autopsy reports were analyzed. ICG was found in 38.99% (n = 62) of the cadavers, 96.77% (n = 60) of which presented with pneumocephalus (PNC) and 40.23% (n = 25) with intravascular gas (IVG). There was a strong correlation between ICG and skull fractures/brain injuries, as well as chest injuries, especially lung injuries. In 13 cases, ICG presented without skull fractures; three of these cases died as a result of stab and incised wounds to the neck and chest. The mean time between trauma and death was significantly longer in the non-ICG group than the ICG group at 2.94 days (0-48 days) and 0.01 day (0-1 day), respectively (p < 0.0001). The presence of ICG is a result of severe neck and chest injuries, including stab and incised wounds. The victims die in a very short amount of time after suffering trauma resulting in ICG. The ability to demonstrate ICG on PMCT scans can be of significance in forming medico-legal opinions.

J	Byrne, MP; McMillan, KR; Coats, B				Byrne, Matt P.; McMillan, Kendall R.; Coats, Brittany			Morphological Analysis of Retinal Microvasculature to Improve Understanding of Retinal Hemorrhage Mechanics in Infants	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						ocular trauma; retinal hemorrhage; pediatrics; mechanics	HEAD TRAUMA; ABNORMALITIES; MORPHOMETRY; CHILDREN; HEALTHY; VESSELS; INJURY; BRAIN	PURPOSE. In this experimental study, we quantify retinal microvasculature morphological features with depth, region, and age in immature and mature ovine eyes. These data identify morphological vulnerabilities in young eyes to inform the mechanics of retinal hemorrhage in children. METHODS. Retinal specimens from the equator and posterior pole of preterm (n = 4) and adult (n = 9) sheep were imaged using confocal microscopy. Vessel segment length, diameter, angular asymmetry, tortuosity, and branch points were quantified using a custom image segmentation code. Significant differences were identified through two-way ANOVAs and correlation analyses. RESULTS. Vessel segment lengths were significantly shorter in immature eyes compared to adults (P < 0.003) and were significantly shorter at increasing depths in the immature retina (P < 0.04). Tortuosity significantly increased with depth, regardless of age (P < 0.05). These data suggest a potential vulnerability of vasculature in the deeper retinal layers, particularly in immature eyes. Preterm retina had significantly more branch points than adult retina in both the posterior pole and equator, and the number increased significantly with depth (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The increased branch points and decreased segment lengths in immature microvasculature suggest that infants will experience greater stress and strain during traumatic loading compared to adults. The increased morphological vulnerability of the immature microvasculature in the deeper layers of the retina suggest that intraretinal hemorrhages have a greater likelihood of occurring from trauma compared to preretinal hemorrhages. The morphological features captured in this study lay the foundation to explore the mechanics of retinal hemorrhage in infants and identify vulnerabilities that explain patterns of retinal hemorrhage in infants.

These injuries vary in clinical presentation, severity, and outcome, with sports-related concussion (SRC) being the most common and more severe sports-related head trauma, such as hemorrhage, and "second impact syndrome" occurring rarely. Understanding the importance of immediate recognition, removal from play, multimodal evaluation, and typical patterns of recovery is necessary to safely manage an athlete with SRC. Proper care of athletes with severe sports-related head trauma requires a high index of suspicion and appropriate initial management to maximize survival and minimize morbidity.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) marks was performed to address the transcriptional regulation of candidate regeneration-associated genes. In this study, we identify a novel enhancer region for induced WNT3A transcription during regeneration of injured cortical neurons. We further demonstrated an increased mono-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) modification at this enhancer concomitant with a topological interaction between sub-regions of this enhancer and with promoter of WNT3A gene.

Postdecisional Processing Delays in Metacognitive Monitoring After Traumatic Brain Injury	JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION			English	Article						confidence judgment; metamemory; postdecisional processing; reaction time; traumatic brain injury	CONFIDENCE; AWARENESS; DECISION; IMPAIRMENTS; METAMEMORY; MODERATE; IMPACT; RECALL	Objective: To document the process by which metacognitive judgments ("online" monitoring of one's own cognitive performance during task completion) are made after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants: Sixteen community-dwelling adults with moderate to severe TBI and 16 matched healthy controls. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional design. Measures: Metacognitive retrospective confidence judgments and reaction times were collected as participants performed a metamemory task. Results: Adults with TBI did not differ from healthy peers in metacognitive accuracy; however, they took significantly longer to make retrospective confidence judgments. Retrospective confidence judgment reaction times were not consistently correlated to measures of processing speed in either sample. Conclusions: Adults with TBI engage in different postdecisional processes to make metacognitive judgments compared with healthy controls. Findings suggest that reaction times may be an important dimension of metacognition to assess clinically after TBI.

We hypothesize that 23.4% HTS in whole blood results in progressive impairment of coagulation in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). STUDY DESIGN: For the in vitro study, whole blood was collected from 10 healthy volunteers, and citrated native thrombelastography was performed with normal saline (0.9%, NS) and 23.4% HTS in serial dilutions (2.5%, 5%, and 10%). For the in vivo experiment, we assessed the effects of 23.4% HTS bolus vs NS on serial thrombelastography and tail-bleeding times in a TBI murine model (n = 10 rats with TBI and 10 controls). RESULTS: For the in vitro work, clinically relevant concentrations of HTS (2.5% dilution) shortened time to clot formation and increased clot strength (maximum amplitude) compared with control and NS. With higher HTS dosing (5% and 10% blood dilution), there was progressive prolongation of time to clot formation, decreased angle, and decreased maximum amplitude. In the in vivo study, there was no significant difference in thrombelastography measurements or tail-bleeding times after bolus administration of 23.4% HTS compared with NS at 2.5% blood volume. CONCLUSIONS: At clinically relevant dilutions of HTS, there is a paradoxical shortening of time to clot formation and increase in clot strength in vitro and no significant effects in a murine TBI model. However, with excess dilution, caution should be exercised when using serial HTS boluses in TBI patients at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy. ((C) 2019 by the American College of Surgeons.

The aim of this study was to determine the AP levels occurring after head trauma in children and adults and to compare these results to the findings observed in the computed tomography (CT) of the respective individuals. Materials and Methods This study was conducted in the period from April 2018 to December 2018 on 92 patients admitted with isolated head trauma and on 80 healthy individuals in similar gender and age groups. The age, gender, and Glasgow Coma Scores of the patients; the cause of the head trauma; and the findings from CT imaging were recorded. Results The levels of AP were significantly lower in the head trauma patients both in the adult and pediatric groups compared with the healthy control groups of respective ages (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels of AP were significantly lower in both the pediatric and adult patients with identified pathologies in the CT images compared with their counterpart control groups (p < 0.001). In predicting an existing pathology in the CT, an AP level of > 138.5 was found to be 85.7% sensitive and 85.3% specific in the pediatric patients, and an AP level of >118.3 was 75% sensitive and 83.5% specific in the adult patients. Conclusion The levels of AP in head trauma patients were reduced in both the pediatric and adult patients and these low levels increase the likelihood of detecting pathology in CT images.

J	Dolanbay, T; Gul, HF; Simsek, AT; Aras, M				Dolanbay, Turgut; Gul, Huseyin Fatih; Simsek, Abdullah Talha; Aras, Murat			Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Cases among Children Younger than 24 Months	PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Brain injury; Pediatric cases; Traumatic brain injury	HEAD-INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Introduction: Accidental head injuries are known to cause serious traumatic brain injury (TBI). Children younger than 2 years of age build a separate group that is more difficult to assess clinically. Investigations targeting TBIs in pediatric cases, particularly in those between 0 and 2 years of age, are limited. Objective: In this study, we reviewed a number of severe accidental head injuries in a cohort of children aged 0-2 years to evaluate the relative incidence, distribution, and clinical success in determining the nature of the cases in the Kars Province of Turkey. Methods: The study targeted 26 -cases who presented to the Emergency Department of Kars Harakani Hospital for TBI between 2017 and 2019 through retrospective chart review. Results and Conclusions: Among the children who presented to the emergency clinic, 2 were newborns, 7 were <1 year of age, and the remaining 17 cases were between 1 and 2 years old. The number of male and female patients was equal, and 5 fatality cases were observed. The most frequent cause of head trauma were falls. We deduced that 6 cases had subarachnoid hemorrhage, 2 cases had subdural hemorrhage, 3 cases had epidural hemorrhage, and 4 cases had contusion. We compared the mean level of the two blood parameters hemoglobin (HGB) and hematocrit (HCT) between fatal and surviving cases and detectedthat both values decreased dramatically in exitus cases. The higher fatality rate in the present study could be attributed to the fact that we targeted only the severe TBI cases. Severe TBI in children younger than 2 years results in a life-threating situation. The risk of fatality might be deduced from the reduction of the HGB and HCT levels as it is significantly lower in fatal cases than in surviving cases.

Progesterone for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis	REVISTA MEDICA DEL URUGUAY			Spanish	Article						Traumatic brain injuries; Progesterone; Meta-Analysis	DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; CLINICAL-TRIAL; NEUROPROTECTION; PROGNOSIS	Objective: to systematically review evidence on the administration of progesterone after a traumatic brain injury in adults and its relationship with mortality and neurological head prognosis. Inclusion criteria: randomized clinical trials that include: patients older than 12 years old, having had an injury (Glasgow <8), comparing the administration of Progesterone versus the control group (placebo or no administration). Methods: we searched the following databases: MEDLINE, the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed, HINARI, EMBASE; Cochrane Injury Group and reference list of articles. Results: there was no reduction in mortality in patients in the control group (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79-1.10 p = 0.41), there were no differences between progesterone and the control group in favorable or adverse neurological outcomes (RR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17 p = 0.20, RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81 -1,08 p = 0.27), respectively. Conclusions: there is no evidence that the administration of progesterone after a traumatic brain injury reduces or improves neurological results, although further good quality studies are required to obtain conclusive results.

All patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine and Department of Neurosurgery from June 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018 with TBI were enrolled.Results:Overall, 199 patients were enrolled. About 62 episodes (31%) of AGF were diagnosed. In the multivariate analysis, women, severe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) classification, frontal lobe injury, abnormal serum sodium, pulmonary infection, and intracranial infection are significantly associated with developing AGF, independent of other prognostic factors.Conclusion:The AGF occurs frequently in intensive care unit patients who are suffering from TBI. In critically ill patients with TBI, women, severe GCS classification, frontal lobe injury, abnormal serum sodium, pulmonary infection, and intracranial infection are independent risk factors for AGF.

PbtO2, ICP, MABP, and CPP were monitored after TBI. Gaussian Processes for machine learning has been used to do simultaneous 3D analysis of the dynamic interrelationship between these parameters. Two critical thresholds for ICP after TBI were identified during our experiments that correlated to human data and may correlate to different intravascular hydrostatic pressures in two different sections of cerebral vasculature. Simultaneous 3D analysis of the dynamic interrelationship between PbtO2 vs. ICP and MABP or CPP could be a better method as opposed to 2-parameter (PbtO2 vs. ICP or CPP) analysis. Current CPP formula may not always reflect the actual cerebral perfusion, therefore we propose the formula as: CPP = PAP - ICP, where PAP is the post arteriolar pressure.

The mechanisms that support effective research engagement with stakeholders have not been studied in the area of concussion. Concussion is a large public health concern worldwide with billions of dollars spent on health care services and research with improvements in care and service delivery not moving forward as quickly as desired. Enabling effective stakeholder engagement could improve concussion research and care. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify potential benefits, challenges, and motivators to engaging in research by gathering the perspectives of adults with lived experience of concussion. Methods: A thematic analysis of qualitative responses collected from a convenience sample attending a provincial brain injury conference (n = 60) was undertaken using open coding followed by axial coding. Results: Four themes regarding benefits to engagement emerged: first-hand account, meaningful recovery, research relevance, and better understanding of gaps. Three forces inhibited engagement: environmental barriers, injury-related constraints, and personal deterrents. Four enablers supported engagement: focus on positive impact, build connections, create a supportive environment, and provide financial assistance. Conclusions: Understanding stakeholder's perspectives on research engagement is an important issue that may serve to improve research quality. There may be unique nuances at play with injury-specific stakeholders that require researchers to consider a balance between reducing inhibitors while supporting enablers. These findings are preliminary and limited. Nevertheless, they provide needed insight and guidance for ongoing investigation regarding improvement of stakeholder engagement in concussion research.

Plasma LXA4 levels tended to increase at 24 and 72 h after GCI. Plasma RvE1, RvE2, RvD1, and RvD2 levels showed a biphasic response to GCI; a significant decrease at 6 h with a return to the levels of the sham group at 24 h, and again a decrease at 72 h. Plasma CD59 levels increased at 6 and 24 h post-GCI, and returned to basal levels at 72 h post-GCI. For TBI, plasma LXA4 levels tended to decrease, while RvE1, RvE2, RvD1, and RvD2 showed barely significant changes. Plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased after GCI and TBI, but with different time courses. These results show that plasma LXA4, RvE1, RvE2, RvD1, RvD2, and CD59 levels display differential responses to GCI and TBI, and need to be evaluated for their usefulness as biomarkers.

J	King, AC				King, Adam C.			Recovery Trajectory of Postural Control Impairments Following a Concussion: A Case Study	JOURNAL OF SPORT REHABILITATION			English	Article						postural stability; motor control; center of pressure; case report	COMPLEXITY; STABILITY; YOUNG; SWAY	Context: Altered postural control represents one of the most common motor consequences following a concussion and there is a paucity of data monitoring the recovery trajectory that identifies the persistent changes of postural control. Objective: To determine whether the recovery trajectory of postural control was consistent across different measures of postural stability and whether increased postural challenge (ie. sloped surface) revealed subtle postural impairments. Design: A single-subject case study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: One concussed individual with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 10) used for comparison. Main Outcome Measures: Center of pressure variability (linear-SD and nonlinear-multiscale entropy) was used to index postural sway preinjury and at periodic intervals following the concussion. Results: The concussed individuals displayed reduced amounts of sway during the initial recovery phase that failed to returned to preinjury levels but reached the level of healthy controls at 1-month postinjury. The multiscale entropy analysis revealed increased center of pressure irregularity throughout recovery that persisted up to 1-month post injury. Conclusions: The findings identified subtle, persistent postural control impairments revealed through the nonlinear analysis of center of pressure and supports the notion that the consequences of a concussion (ie, impaired postural control) need to be considered beyond the resolution of behavioral symptoms.

Lissner: The Father of Impact Biomechanics	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							CONCUSSION; MECHANISM; INJURY	Professor Herbert R. Lissner was a pioneer in impact biomechanics, having initiated research on the injury mechanisms, mechanical response, and human tolerance of the human brain to blunt impact 80 years ago-in 1939. This paper summarizes the contributions made by Professor Lissner in head injury as well as in the many areas of impact biomechanics in which he was involved. In 1977, the Bioengineering Division of ASME established the H. R. Lissner Award to recognize outstanding career achievements in the area of biomechanics. In 1987, this award was converted to a society-wide Medal, and to date it has been awarded to 44 exemplary researchers and educators. The lead author of this paper was Professor Lissner's first and only Ph.D. student, and he offers a unique insight into his research and contributions.

A validation study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; Guidelines; Management; Neurosurgical intervention; Head computed tomography; Validation	GLASGOW COMA SCALE; HEAD-INJURY; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; INTERHOSPITAL TRANSFERS; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; DECISION INSTRUMENT; ADULT PATIENTS; ICU; DETERIORATION	Background: There is variability in the management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and abnormal findings on their initial head computed tomography (CT). The main objective of this study was to validate the value of the Important Brain Injury (IBI) criteria, introduced by the Canadian CT-Head Rule, in predicting the need for surgical intervention. The secondary objective was to identify independent predictors for neurosurgical intervention. Methods: This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort of adult patients presenting to the ED of one tertiary care, academic center, between 2008 and 2012, with MTBI and an abnormal initial head CT. Neurosurgical intervention was at the discretion of the treating physician. The sensitivity and specificity of the IBI criteria were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI95%). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors for neurosurgical intervention with the direct entry method. Results: A total of 678 patients (male - 65.9%, mean age - 62.5 years) were included, of whom 114 (16.8%) required neurosurgical intervention. All patients requiring neurosurgical intervention met IBI criteria on their initial head CT (sensitivity of 100% [CI95% 96.8-100]). However, 368 (652%) patients with findings of IBI did not require neurosurgical intervention (specificity of 34.8% [CI95% 30.8-38.8]). Age over 65 was independently associated with neurosurgical intervention in the IBI population. Conclusion: The IBI criteria for MTBI identified all patients who required neurosurgical intervention; however its specificity is low. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Data were collected from the hospital medical information system. The patients who suffered from severe head injury met with the disease classification system, traumatic statistics, with or without brain surgery, and patient medical records of a regional teaching hospital were included in the study. Patients were followed with telephone contact 1 year after discharge. The Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Functional Independence Measure were used as tools for prognostic evaluation. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital. Results: Patients who were 65 years of age and older diagnosed with severe head injury (Injury Severity Score [ISS] >= 16) were included. Between January 2009 and September 2015, a total of 142 patients were collected with 88 men (62%) and 54 women (38%). The mean age was 76.6 +/- 6.6 years. Head injury was caused by traffic accidents for 73 patients (51.4%) and by falls for 69 patients (48.6%). There were 122 patients with subdural hemorrhage, 82 with intracerebral hemorrhage, 71 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 11 with epidural hemorrhage. Forty-one patients (28.9%) had simple head injury and 101 patients had multiple head injuries. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale was 5.4 +/- 1.9, and the mean ISS was 24.3 +/- 9.2. Thirty-eight patients (26.8%) refused surgery and 104 patients (73.2%) underwent brain surgery. Among 142 patients, 70 (49.3%) died and 72 (50.7%) survived, with 16 patients (11.3%) classified as good condition and 126 (88.7%) as poor condition. After 1 year, those who underwent brain surgery had a better prognosis than those who refused surgery (P = 0.01). Conclusion: Older adults with severe head injuries often face disability, a vegetative state, or death. In this study, those who underwent brain surgery had better survival, and 27.6% (16/58) of those who survived were able to live independently after 1 year.

Correlating the passive response of eye and brain to head impact using MEMS IMUs on 3D-printed human head phantom	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						TBI; concussion; real-time diagnosis; MEMS IMU; passive eye response; head phantom	COLLEGIATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; ONE-WAY ANOVA; MULTIPLE COMPARISONS; UNITED-STATES; BIOMECHANICS; INJURY; CONCUSSION; VALIDATION; LATENCY	Objective: The eye may act as a surrogate for the brain in response to head acceleration during an impact. This paper reports the latest demonstration of the correlation between the passive human eye accelerations and the brain accelerations under head impacts using a model eye/brain/skull phantom. Approach: Experiments investigating rotational and linear accelerations were performed on a 3D-printed human head phantom, along with rotational experiments on a human volunteer. Data acquired during the passive eye response (PER) periods were processed and analysed using statistical methods including one-way normal analysis of variance, linear regression fit, and Pearson R correlation. Main results: The results have shown that, at least on the 3D-printed human head phantom, strong correlations can be found between the eye and the brain during the PER, which indicates a potential use of microelectromechanical systems inertial measurement units in real-time on-field monitoring and diagnosis of concussions or traumatic brain injuries.

Trauma Recall and the Exposure Therapy Process	JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE			English	Article						Posttraumatic stress disorder; trauma memory; exposure therapy; habituation; extinction	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; PROLONGED EXPOSURE; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; BRAIN-INJURY; SHELL SHOCK; VETERANS; PTSD; FEAR; HABITUATION; EXTINCTION	Theoretical models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as exposure therapy (EXP) methodology suggest that trauma recall is crucial to altering the conditioned fear response associated with PTSD. However, it is unclear whether limited recall of the trauma event attenuates treatment outcomes. This study examined whether the extent of difficulty recalling aspects of a traumatic event affected fear activation, habituation, number of sessions, session length, and diagnostic outcomes in 166 Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn veterans. Extent of trauma recall difficulty neither attenuated veterans' ability to achieve fear activation and habituation nor affected treatment outcomes. Findings suggest that even veterans who reported greater difficulty recalling their trauma event can engage successfully and benefit from EXP. This research is the first to examine trauma event recall in the context of the EXP process and contributes to the current body of literature that aims to address the question: "For whom do treatments work?"

Subjects and Methods: Around 229 patients with acute TBI and 30 healthy subjects were evaluated for the serum levels of Tau protein on 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after TBI. The relationships of the serum levels of Tau protein and initial GCS and GOS at 6 months post-injury were also analyzed. Further, 95 TBI patients were assessed with their cognitive function with Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score. Results: Serum Tau was significantly higher in patients with TBI at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The serum Tau at each point was significantly lower respectively in the patients with mild TBI than that in medium and severe TBI. The serum Tau was significantly lower in patients with good outcome compared to the poor outcome group. The early serum Tau was negatively correlated with both GCS and GOS. In the TBI group, 39 (41%) out of 95 patients developed cognitive dysfunction assessed by MoCA. Tau protein at day 1, 3, and 5 after TBI was significantly correlated with cognitive dysfunction at 6 months after TBI. Conclusions: Acute Tau associations with neurological outcomes and cognition may implicate white matter damage and neuronal degeneration. Serum Tau may be used as a reliable biological marker for early diagnosis and cognitive recovery following TBI.

J	Ranaweera, L; Kumari, MI; Samaraweerachchi, UI				Ranaweera, Lanka; Kumari, Mahadula, I; Samaraweerachchi, Upeksha, I			Injuries at the National Sport Festival Taekwondo Championship in Sri Lanka	MEDICINA DELLO SPORT			English	Article						Martial arts; Sports; Athletic injuries; Contusions	COMPETITION INJURIES; CHILDREN	BACKGROUND: Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that had been growing in popularity in Sri Lanka and internationally. Although studies have examined injuries in other non-contact sports, to date, no published medical study has examined injuries in taekwondo competitions in Sri Lanka. The purpose of this study was to identify the injury profile in the "National Sport Festival Taekwondo Championship" in Sri Lanka. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. In the competition, 193 athletes were observed prospectively to detect the injury type, site of injury, severity of injury and the rate of injury. Injury data were recorded using an interviewer administered questionnaire with the help of the attending physician. The software program "SPSS 16.0' was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Importantly, 78 injuries were recorded. The most prevalent injury type was contusions (67.9%) followed by lacerations (12.8%), sprain (5.1%), concussion (5.1%) and fractures (3.8%). The lower limbs were determined as the most prevalent anatomical region of the body to sustain an injury during a competition followed by the head and neck. The most frequent injuries were mild injures (71.8%) which is followed by moderate injuries (17.9%) and the equal frequency of 5.1% for both severe and critical injuries. The injury rate was found to be 220.3 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. CONCLUSIONS: The most common injury location and type were found to be the lower limb and contusion, respectively. The majority of injuries appeared to be of mild in nature. Most importantly, the injury rate in Sri Lankan taekwondo athletes is very much higher than the rates reported from the other parts in the world. There is an urgent need of launching programs related to injury prevention among the players and the referees in order to decrease the rate of taekwondo injuries in Sri Lanka.

Delayed detection of neurological worsening in the acute setting increases traumatic brain injury lethality	BIOMEDICA			Spanish	Article						Craniocerebral trauma; Glasgow coma scale; prognosis; critical care outcome; accidents; traffic; mortality	EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Traumatic brain injury is a leading worldwide cause of death and disability in young people. Severity classification is based on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). However, the presence of Neurological Worsening in the Acute Setting is not always according to the initial severity, suggesting an underestimation of real magnitude of the injury. Objective: To study the correlation between the initial severity given by the GCS and the patient outcome, in the context of different clinical and tomographic variables. Materiales y methods: A retrospective cohort was conducted for patients with closed traumatic brain injury (n=490) in two tertiary centres in Barranquilla whom required a stay in the intensive care unit. Risk estimate was established by calculating the OR (95% CI). alpha = 0.05 is used as a significance level. Results: 41,0% of all patients required orotracheal intubation, being 51,2% initially classified as moderate, and 6,0% as mild traumas. Delay in time for aggressive management mainly affect moderate group, in whom the lethality increased to 100% when time to detection of neurological worsening and, therefore, to treat aggressively was delayed beyond 4 to 8 hours. Also, this group of patients showed lethality <20,0% when treated aggressively within the first hour. Conclusions: Risk of lethality in traumatic brain injury increases with the delayed detection of neurological worsening in the acute setting, especially when aggressive management is performed after the first hour postrauma.

Method: The study sample was a severe TBI which classified from initial glasgow coma scale (GCS) score <= 8 in the West Nusa Tenggara General Hospital, who met the inclusion criteria in between 2016 and 2018 time periode. All samples underwent urgent subdural drainage management and also tracheostomy. Clinical outcome were assesed by the glasgow outcome scale (GOS). All analyses determined by the Medical Record data. Result: 62 severe TBI patients who underwent subdural drainage and early tracheostomy procedures consisting of 53 (85.5%) men and 9 (14.5%) women. The average age of the study subjects was 30.47 years old with the youngest age of 3 years old and the oldest was 77 years old. The outcome of the study subjects consisted of 48 patients survived (77.4%) and 14 patients died (22.6%). Conclusion: Subdural drainage and early tracheostomy are recommended novel to perform on severe TBI patient in the area with the modest neurosurgical settings, due to lower mortality rate and better end result.

However, there remains uncertainty about the bleeding risk, rate of hematoma expansion, and the efficacy of reversal strategies in these patients. Objective: This study aims to identify the risk of traumatic hemorrhagic complications in patients with TBI using DOACs. Methods: In this retrospective study we included patients with TBI. All TBI patients were using DOACs, attended one of the three EDs of our hospital between January 2016 and October 2019, and received a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. The primary outcome was any traumatic intracranial hemorrhage on CT. Secondary outcomes were the use of reversal agents, secondary neurological deterioration, a neurosurgical intervention within 30 days after the injury, length of stay (LOS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and mortality. Results: Of the included patients (N = 316), 24 patients (7.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-9.8) presented with a traumatic intracranial hematoma (ICH). Seven patients (2.2%, 95% CI 0.6-3.8) received a reversal agent and 1 patient (0.3%, 95% CI -0.3-0.9) underwent a neurosurgical intervention. Of the 24 patients with a traumatic ICH, progression of the lesion was seen in 6 patients (1.9%, 95% CI 0.4-3.4). The mean LOS was 6.5 days (95% CI 3.0-10.1) and the mean GOS at discharge was 4 (95% CI 3.6-4.6). Death occurred in 1 patient (0.3%, 95% CI -0.3-0.9) suffering from an ICH. Conclusion: Based on the present findings it can be postulated that TBI patients using DOACs have a low risk for ICH. Hematoma progression occurred, however, in a substantial number of patients. Considering the retrospective nature of the present study, future prospective trials are needed to confirm this finding. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Santing, Juliette A.

They can develop post-concussion syndrome (PCS), which includes sleep abnormalities such as obstructive sleep apnea. It is unclear how specific sleep problems manifest in PCS and how it relates to cognition and symptomology. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on PCS patients seen at the University Health Network (UHN) Concussion Clinic and sent for sleep study. Neuropsychology tests, concussion features, PCS symptoms, and demographics were abstracted from clinical charts. Sleep measures were abstracted from the overnight sleep study. Data were analyzed using chi-squared tests and linear regression. Results: Fifty-one patients completed the sleep study; 78% of these were diagnosed with sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea reported significantly more memory symptoms. A trend existed for higher total symptom number. Age was significantly different between the two groups. Women and men were equally at risk of being diagnosed with sleep apnea. Conclusions: Sleep apnea is common in PCS patients complaining of non-restorative sleep and/or waking up with headaches. Sleep apnea was associated with more memory symptoms. PCS patients are at higher risk for sleep apnea and sleep study should be considered if complaining of non-restorative sleep and/or waking up with headaches, regardless of sex and other known risk factors.

Methods: Neurocyte proliferation and activity of lactate dehydrogenase were assessed by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to determine the effect of midazolam on LC3, Bax, p62 and Beclin-1 protein expressions. Results: The suppression of neurocyte proliferation byconvulsion was alleviated significantly (p < 0.05) by midazolum treatment. Exposure of convulsion model of neurocytes to midazolum suppressed LC3, Bax, p62 and Beclin-1 protein expression. Midazolum exposure of convulsion model of neurocytes suppressed LDH, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities. The 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) treatment also significantly (p < 0.05) promoted neurocyte viability after convulsion induction. In convulsion-induced neurocytes, 3-MA exposure suppressed expression of caspase-3/8/9, LC3, Bax, Beclin-1 and p62, while application of midazolum treatment to the rats with convulsion markedly decreased brain water content and neurocyte apoptosis (p < 0.05). Treatment with midazolum inhibited LC3, p62 and Beclin-1 expression in the rat model of convulsion. Conclusion: Midazolum promotes neurocyte proliferation and inhibits edema development via downregulation of autophagy. Therefore, midazolum can potentially be used for the treatment of convulsion, but further studies need to be carried out first.

J	Skilbeck, C; Thomas, M; Holm, K				Skilbeck, Clive; Thomas, Matt; Holm, Kieran			Predicting mood outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI): PTA & demographic variables	BRAIN IMPAIRMENT			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; hospital anxiety and depression scale; mood prediction; demographic variables; gender; age; IQ; relationship status; employment status; socio-economic status	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DEPRESSION FOLLOWING MILD; ANXIETY STRESS SCALES; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; MODERATE; EMPLOYMENT; COMMUNITY; REHABILITATION; OUTPATIENTS	Background and aims: Mood disturbance is frequent after traumatic brain injury (TBI), often assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Research supports a three-factor HADS structure (anxiety, depression, and psychomotor), although this has not been used to investigate demographic variables and mood outcome post-TBI. This study examined severity of TBI, demographic variables [age, gender, estimated premorbid IQ (EIQ), relationship status, employment status, socio-economic status (SES)], and mood outcome, using HADS factor scores from a large adult population sample in Tasmania. Method: HADS factor scores were calculated for an initial sample of 596 adults. The sample sizes varied according to those attending at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months post-TBI and the available data for each dependent variable. Results: Significantly higher anxiety, depression, and psychomotor scores were reported at most follow-ups by females, the middle-aged, and those with lower IQs. Longer post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) was associated with significantly greater mood problems. Occasional significant findings at earlier follow-ups for the factors were noted for those unemployed. Other variables were rarely significant. PTA, premorbid IQ, and Age were included in most Multiple Regression equations predicting outcome for the factors, with Gender included for Anxiety and depression at 6 months after injury. Conclusions: Key demographic variables and PTA severity relate to mood post-TBI, and contribute to predicting mood outcome. Differences in findings for the three factors support their use in clinical practice.

Seven patients with acquired brain injury (i.e. stroke, traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) with a mean postinjury time of 4.3 months (SD = 1.25) and mean age of 34.5 years (SD = 18.6) were recruited for the study. The group program consisted of 10 sessions twice a week and included cognitive strategy training, social skills training, and psychoeducation. Structured interviews and neuropsychological tests were used before and after the training to determine the influence of the interventions on daily life tasks and attentional networks performance involving cognitive and behavioral domains. GOALS influenced self-reports of positive effect on the individual goals set by the patients. Training had a positive influence on executive control and memory. The results from the present study suggest that it is feasible to implement GOALS manualized executive function training in Slovenia, with the patients in a somewhat more acute stage than in previous studies, and that GOALS training may be a promising nonpharmacological treatment for cognitive and behavioral difficulties after acquired brain injury.

An experimental study of two forms of concussion advice on planned physical activity	BRAIN IMPAIRMENT			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; concussion; recovery; rest; exercise; experiment	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; HEAD-INJURY; SPORT HELD; REST; RECOMMENDATIONS; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; EXERCISE	Background and aims Best practice management for medically cleared concussion is to commence a graded return to activity, as tolerated, and within 24-48 h of the injury. Patients may encounter this or other advice if they search the Internet, or when they are discharged from care. It is not yet known how patients would interpret this advice, particularly for specific activities. This study compared the effect of two forms of concussion advice on physical activity plans. It was expected that compared to the advice to gradually return to activity, the advice to 'rest' would lead to reduced activity plans. Methods Concussion simulators received the generic advice to undertake 1 week of (i) rest (no physical activity [NPA],n= 115) or (ii) graded physical activity (GPA,n= 104). Activity plans were recorded using items from the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Rest-Activity Questionnaire (MTBI-RAQ). Results There was a significant group difference in activity plans (NPA < GPA, total score and for all MTBI-RAQ items,p's <= 0.001, medium-to-large effects). The average NPA response was for a significant reduction from pre-injury for 14 activities, with no planned change for 2 activities (walking, household chores). In the GPA group, there were plans to reduce (n(items)= 7), continue (n(items)= 5) or increase activities (n(items)= 4; e.g., swimming). Both groups proposed to decrease 'high-risk' activities (e.g., heavy lifting). Conclusion As expected, there was a significant effect of the type of advice on physical activity plans. Compared to the GPA advice, the NPA advice led to a significant reduction of planned physical activity. If concussed patients seek or receive advice that recommends NPA, it may prompt activity plans that are unnecessarily restrictive. If GPA advice is given, it leads to varied plans, with fewer restrictions overall, and avoidance of higher risk physical activities. Generic GPA advice has the potential to facilitate active recovery for concussion; however, patients would still likely benefit from a professional consultation about their plan and support to safely implement it, and this should be investigated in future research.

AHT is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in young children, particularly those younger than 12 months of age. We describe two patients who developed West syndrome, which is a severe epilepsy syndrome composed of the triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography, and developmental arrest or regression, possibly attributable to AHT. Case 1 was a 5-month-old boy presented with generalized convulsive status epilepticus when a babysitter had cared for him. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibited a subdural hemorrhage with diffuse brain edema and a midline shift highly suggestive of AHT. He developed West syndrome at the age of 10 months. Case 2 was a 6-month-old girl presented infantile spasms and diagnosed with West syndrome. Although she had poor weight gain due to inadequate care by her mother, there were no history of trauma, no cutaneous finding, and no developmental delay. Brain MRI performed when West syndrome was diagnosed revealed contusional tears highly suggestive of AHT. The MRI finding indicated that contusional tears had occurred 1-2 months before the development of West syndrome. There are no reports of West syndrome due to contusional tears. AHT may be an important risk factor for postnatal West syndrome. It is noteworthy that evidence of AHT was found only after West syndrome onset, as in Case 2. The onset of West syndrome may contribute to the finding that AHT had occurred earlier.

However, there are a myriad of complications because of absence of the bone flap. A novel technique, four-quadrant osteoplastic decompressive craniotomy (FoQOsD) retains the bone flap while achieving adequate cerebral decompression. METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled trial of 115 patients with TBI needing decompressive surgery was conducted. Of these patients, 59 underwent DC and 56 underwent FoQOsD. The primary outcome determined was functional status at 6 months using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified in baseline characteristics between both groups. Mean Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score was comparable at 6 months (4.28 in DC vs. 4.38 in FoQOsD; P = 0.856). Further, 22 of 58 patients in the DC group had died (38%) compared with 25 of 55 patients in the FaQOsD group (44.6%) (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.36; P = 0.6) (1 patient lost to follow-up in each group). A favorable outcome was seen in 56.8% of patients in the DC group versus 54.4% of patients in the FoQOsD group (P = 0.74). Presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 1.364-37.7; P = 0.020), opposite side contusions (OR, 3.838; 95% CI, 1.614-9.131; P = 0.002) and anisocoria (OR, 3.235; 95% CI, 1.490-7.026; P = 0.003) preoperatively were individual factors that played a significant role in final outcome. CONCLUSIONS: FoQOsD is as efficacious as conventional DC with the added benefit of avoiding a second surgery. The procedure is associated with better cosmesis and fewer complications.

However, their caregivers' knowledge and understanding of symptoms may influence how the injury is managed. Primary objective: To investigate the knowledge of New Zealand (NZ) parents about TBI and concussion. Method and procedures: Parents (n = 205) of children aged 5-13 years completed a pen-and-paper or online survey containing questions examining their knowledge of TBI terminology, TBI symptoms and knowledge about concussion management. Main outcomes and results: A high proportion (61%) of parents did not think that a concussion was the same as a brain injury. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was the most endorsed symptom of TBI. However, 69% of participants were aware that TBI could occur without LOC. On average, parents correctly identified 19.5 (67.3%) of the 29 symptoms of TBI, but also identified 2.0 (11.9%) of the 17 distractor symptoms as being TBI related. Demographic factors and experience of TBI/concussion were associated with TBI symptom identification accuracy and concussion knowledge. Conclusions: Further education of parents is needed to ensure they recognise the signs and symptoms of concussion/mild TBI so that they can make informed decisions on how best to manage their child's injury.

Head trauma caused by accidents has been an issue of concern in Taiwan. Although serious long-term effects have been documented, research on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains scarce. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to analyze post-concussion symptome (PCS) and the relevant impact on physical, emotional, and cognitive functions. Materials and Methods: During 2012-2013, 105 patients with mTBI in a single hospital were surveyed based on the Rivermead postconcussion symptoms questionnaire in 1 week, and their postinjury status was followed 1 month later. The collected data were analyzed using the paired t-test and descriptive statistics. Results: The collected data were included patient demographics and pretrauma risk factors. A total of 101 patients were subject to mTBI. The rate increased among males and the population aged from 21 to 44 years old. The most common cause of injury was the motorcycle accident, where half of the patients had an initial loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia. Partial resolution of symptoms was noted within 1 month for all participants, but some symptoms persisted (P < 0.0001). In general, patients (especially females) recovered faster from physical impairment. The analysis provides information about the impacts and shows the increased risk of neurocranial traumas related to mTBI. Conclusion: This study presents patients' PCS symptoms in different periods. Those symptoms improved gradually in 1 month, but some symptoms persisted, especially those affecting emotional and cognitive functions. Most patients in this study were young, and the illness had impact on the patients' daily life. As shown by the results, the risk factors were associated with prolonged PCS among females. Aside from physical symptoms, special attention should be paid to mental care as well. More predictors for mTBI may improve medical care quality and reduce losses of medical resources.

J	Roenn-Smidt, H; Larsen, K; Pallesen, H				Roenn-Smidt, Helle; Larsen, Kristian; Pallesen, Hanne			The practices of body in rehabilitation after stroke: a qualitative study of how physiotherapy affects identity reconstruction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOTHERAPY			English	Article						Physiotherapy; stroke; practices; body; identity; habitus	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SELF; IMPACT; GAIT	Background: The rehabilitation process after a stroke transits through different treatment options organised in different settings, which thereby structure the patient's possibilities for constructing identity. Aim: To investigate how physiotherapy located in hospitals, municipal rehabilitation, and private clinics during rehabilitation after stroke provide different practices related to the patient body and how this creates different and opposed positions for construction identity after stroke. Design and methods: A qualitative longitudinal study based on empirical data that followed 12 patients with stroke through their rehabilitation, consisted of observations of interactions between physiotherapists and patients, as well as individual in-depth interviews with physiotherapists and patients. Result: Building on Bourdieu's notions of field, capital, and habitus, different bodily habitus seemed to work as capital throughout the rehabilitation process. Positions available for habitus were around the disembodied body, the malfunctioning body, the defective body, the remodelled body, and the body altered. These different bodies interwove and shifted across the different sites and phases of the patient's rehabilitation. Conclusion: The relations between patients, physiotherapists and field constructed different bodily positions in the physiotherapeutic practice, where some bodies were included while other bodies were excluded. This shaped varying practices and different potentials for the patients' identity reconstruction.

Standardized Volume Dosing Protocol of 23.4% Hypertonic Saline for Pediatric Critical Care: Initial Experience	ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article						hypertonic saline; pediatrics; electrolytes; drug administration; central nervous system; dosage forms; osmotherapy	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; REFRACTORY INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; HEAD-INJURY; MANAGEMENT; PRESSURE; CHILDREN; WATER	Background: Standardized volume dosing of 23.4% hypertonic saline (HTS) exists for adults, but the concentration, dosing and administration of HTS in pediatrics is variable. With emerging pediatric experience of 23.4% HTS, a standard volume dose approach may be helpful. Objective: To describe initial experience with a standardized 23.4% HTS weight-based volume dosing protocol of 10, 20, or 30 mL in the pediatric intensive care unit. Methods: Standard volume doses of 23.4% HTS were developed from weight dosing equivalents of 3% HTS. Pre and post sodium and intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements were compared with paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The site of administration and complications were noted. Results: A total of 16 pediatric patients received 37 doses of 23.4% HTS, with the smallest patient weighing 11 kg. For protocol compliance, 17 doses (46%) followed recommended dosing, 19 were less volume than recommended (51%), and 1 dose (3%) was more than recommended. Mean increase in sodium was 3.5 mEq/L (95% CI = 2-5 mEq/L); P < 0.0001. The median decrease in ICP was 10.5 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR] 8.3-19.5) for a 37% (IQR 25%-64%) reduction. Most doses were administered through central venous access, although peripheral intravenous administrations occurred in 4 patients without complication. Conclusion and Relevance: Three standard-volume dose options of 23.4% HTS based on weight increases sodium and reduces ICP in pediatric patients. Standard-volume doses may simplify weight-based dosing, storage and administration for pediatric emergencies, although the optimum dose, and safety of 23.4% HTS in children remains unknown.

However, little is known about the nature of the difficulties encountered and the ways in which these individuals deal with them. None of the few studies on wayfinding by people with cognitive disabilities have explored the various specific difficulties they meet in everyday life. Using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology, this study aimed at profiling the types of difficulties encountered in urban mobility and the associated problem-solving strategies. In order to provide more direct evidence from the field, we conducted semi-structured interviews using the critical incident technique (Flanagan, 1954). Among the 66 participants interviewed, 44 had cognitive disabilities and 22 were matched controls. The analysis of the transcripts showed in particular an overall reduced autonomy in problem-solving strategies for people with a cognitive disability. The multiple correspondence analysis highlighted three main types of complex situations, covering a comprehensive range of complex situations that are met in everyday life by these individuals. Results also indicated that people with cognitive disabilities request assistance from another person more frequently when a complex event occurs. These situations are discussed as potential cues for improvements in navigational aids. Conclusions and perspectives are provided to improve wayfinding among people with cognitive disabilities.

It is important to assess and grade the TBI as soon as possible to guide management and decrease the comorbidities. Various guidelines have been issued by the neurosurgical societies to immediately assess and intervene when ever required. In this study, we have tried to assess the role of basal cisternal effacement in the management and prognosis of RTA patients, and hence tried to simplify the prognostication process and improve the patient management. METHODS 100 subjects were studied who were having history of traumatic head injury. NCCT was done for all the patients using 128 slice Multidetector CT- Ingenuity (Philips Medical Systems, USA). Other parameters like pupillary reaction, GCS at the time of presentation, midline shift and associated fractures and bleed were assessed. All the patients were followed up till the time of discharge. The data so obtained was analysed. RESULTS Parameters like age, pupillary reflex, GCS at presentation, associated intracranial bleed, associated cranial vault fractures and presence or absence of midline shift correlated well with the final outcome with p value consistently <0.05. We analysed that the degree of obliteration of perimesencephalic cistern was a good prognostic marker in traumatic head injury patients. 36% of patients had favourable outcome out of which none of the patients had obliterated perimesencephalic cistern or interpeduncular cisterns. 64% patients had unfavourable outcome out of which 60% and 48% had obliterated or partially obliterated perimesencephalic cisterns and interpeduncular cisterns respectively, and only 4% and 16% had normal perimesencephalic cisterns and interpeduncular cisterns respectively. CONCLUSIONS It is important to investigate, grade and prognosticate traumatic head injury patients at the earliest. Our study and various other studies prove that various clinical predictors including age, Glasgow coma scale, and pupil reactivity correlate with outcome of patient. Presence of midline shift, intraventricular haemorrhage, and obliteration of cisterns in patients of traumatic brain injury also correlate with the outcome and can be used; thus, making the prognostication process much easier. These findings can be used on the first day of admission itself.

However, the possible involvement of PGRN in regulating inflammatory response and mediating neuronal activity is still not well-defined. Here, we demonstrate that PGRN deficiency enhances the age-dependent increase of neuronal activity in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Aging increased neuronal activity in the PVN of the hypothalamus, and PGRN deficiency enhanced the effects of age on hypothalamic neuronal activity. Aging increased the lysosomal biogenesis and inflammatory response in microglia, which was also aggravated in PGRN-knockout mice. Moreover, PGRN deficiency enhanced interleukin-1 beta and lysosomal genes levels. These results suggest that PGRN deficiency may enhance the age-dependent increase of neuronal activity possibly because PGRN facilitates immunological responses through regulating lysosomal function.

Headache long after pediatric concussion: presence, intensity, interference, and association with cognition	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; cognition; headache disorders	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; POSTTRAUMATIC MIGRAINE; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; CHRONIC PAIN; CHILDREN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREDICTOR; RECOVERY	Objective: Document headache presence, intensity, and interference after concussion(s), as well as examine its association with cognition. Participants: Participants 8-19 years of age were assessed on average 34 months (SD = 21.5) after an orthopedic injury (OI, n = 29), single concussion (n = 21), or multiple concussions (n = 15). Measures: Headache intensity was rated using the Headache Rating Scale and headache interference was rated using the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI). Cognition was rated using the PCSI and measured using CNS Vital Signs. Results: Type of injury did not differ significantly in headache presence or intensity. However, there was a dose-response relationship found for children's ratings of headache interference, which was rated highest among children with multiple concussions, intermediate among those with single concussion, and lowest among children with OI. Both headache intensity and interference ratings correlated significantly with self and parent ratings of cognition on the PCSI, but not with cognitive test performance. Conclusions: Youth with single or multiple concussions report greater headache interference - but not higher headache intensity - compared to youth without concussion. Although higher headache intensity and interference were associated with more self-reported cognitive symptoms, headaches did not correlate with cognitive test performance.

However, malrotation often occurs in MISs when closed reduction methods are used. This study aims to define specific palpable landmarks to help surgeons determine the correct torsional angle and reduce the incidence of malrotation. Methods Twenty-eight normal humeral computed tomography scans were retrieved from our image database. One line was drawn through the vertices of the intertubercular sulcus of the humeral head in the coronal view, and another line was drawn through the longest axis between the medial and lateral condyles in the coronal view. The angle between these two lines was measured at least 3 times for each scan. Results The profile of the intertubercular sulcus tangent line of the humeral head and the axis of the distal humerus was identified as the most accurate method for assessing the precision of torsion during MIS for humeral shaft fractures. The transepicondylar axis line is more internally rotated than the intertubercular sulcus tangent line. The mean angle was measured to be 41.1 degrees. Conclusions The axis of the distal humeral condyles is internally rotated by approximately 41.1 degrees compared with the intertubercular sulcus tangent line of the humeral head. Minimally invasive surgeries can be performed by using these palpable landmarks. The torsional deformities can be reduced with the proper angle adjustment without the need for fluoroscopy. It can also be used to treat unstable comminuted humeral fractures.

Methods: Twenty-nine TBI stakeholders participated in focus group discussions. Qualitative analyses were conducted both manually and using Dedoose software. Results: Participant-identified barriers included stigma associated with experiencing neuropsychiatric symptoms and poor insurance coverage. Facilitators included treatment focused on education of neuropsychiatric symptoms after TBI and having a comprehensive caregiver plan. Best strategies for maintaining TBI PCOR network included having a well-defined project, continued regular meetings, and on-going education of network members. Pertinent research topics included TBI and aging, factors influencing outcomes after TBI, substance use disorders related to TBI, and effectiveness of telemental health services. Needed policy changes included making TBI neuropsychiatry education accessible to stakeholders and improving accessibility of TBI neuropsychiatric care. Conclusion: TBI stakeholders identified several facilitators of care for neuropsychiatric symptoms after TBI and suggested research topics and best practices for conducting PCOR in this area.

Methods: A total of 96 participants aged 5 to 12 years (M-age = 9.55, SD = 2.20) completed three assessment time points: 48 h postinjury (T0), 2 to 4 days postinjury (T1), and 2 weeks postinjury (T2). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze differences between cognitive and somatic symptoms over time, while the Friedman test was used to analyze differences within symptom type over time. Results: Cognitive PCS were found to be significantly higher than somatic PCS at all assessment time points and were also found to significantly decline from 4 days onwards postinjury; in contrast, somatic PCS significantly declined as early as 48 hpostinjury. Discussion: Differences between cognitive and somatic PCS emerge as early as a few days postinjury, with cognitive PCS being more persistent than somatic PCS across 2 weeks. Research in symptom-specific interventions may be of benefit in helping young children manage severe PCS as early as 2 weeks postinjury.	[Teh, Zoe; Takagi, Michael; Hearps, Stephen J.

J	Baker, HP; Volchenko, E; Athiviraham, A				Baker, Hayden P.; Volchenko, Elan; Athiviraham, Aravind			Does the MLB's collision at home plate rule change prevent concussion injuries in catchers?	PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE			English	Article						Baseball; concussions; catchers; home plate collisions; MLB; sports	COLLATERAL LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION; CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; LEAGUE BASEBALL PITCHERS; TOMMY JOHN SURGERY; PERFORMANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STATEMENT; RETURN; SPORT	Background: In 2013, appropriate conduct of both the catcher and baserunner at the home plate was outlined with the addition of rule 7.13. This new rule was mandated in order to protect athletes from 'egregious' collisions at the home plate. The aims of this study were to quantify the impact of the Collision at Home Plate rule on concussion rates among MLB catchers, and time spent on the DL with concussion symptoms, before and after rule 7.13 was officially enacted (2012-2013, 2015-2016). Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the rate of concussions suffered by MLB catchers would be significantly lower after the enactment of rule 7.13 and that there would be no significant difference in time spent on the DL between the two cohorts. Study design: Retrospective Cohort Methods: The data was compiled using publicly available information extracted from MLB transactions. All MLB catchers placed on the DL for a concussion injury from 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 were included in this study. Relative risk (with 95% CI) was calculated by using the number of injuries per 1,0000 athletic exposures for the 2 seasons under the rule change (2015-2016) versus the previous 2 seasons (2012-2013). Results: Among catchers the relative risk of concussion per 1000 athletic exposures was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.11-0.85) when comparing the 2 seasons after the introduction of rule 7.13 (2015, 2016) versus the 2 seasons before (2012, 2013). There was no significant statistical difference in average time catchers spent on the DL for concussion injuries when comparing the 2012 and 2013 seasons versus 2015 and 2016. Conclusions: The MLB's rule limiting home plate collisions significantly reduced the number of concussions suffered by MLB catchers.

Reward and immune responses in adolescent females following experimental traumatic brain injury	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Sex differences; Addiction; Behavior; Neuroinflammation	SEX-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VAGINAL CYTOLOGY; ESTROUS-CYCLE; COCAINE; MICROGLIA; RATS; REINSTATEMENT; CONCUSSIONS; MECHANISM	The pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) adversely affects many brain regions, often resulting in the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders including substance use disorders (SUD). Although traditionally thought to be an epidemic that predominantly affects males, recent clinical studies report females have higher rates of concussions and longer recovery times than males. Yet, how neurotrauma, particularly deep within the brain, between the sexes is differentially manifested remains largely unknown. The risk of TBI peaks during adolescence when neuronal networks that regulate reward behaviors are not fully developed. Previously, using the conditioned place preference (CPP) assay, we found that adolescent TBI increased susceptibility to the rewarding effects of cocaine in male mice. Further, we observed augmented inflammatory profiles, increased microglial phagocytosis of neuronal proteins, and decreased neuronal spine density in the NAc. Notably, the extent of sex differences in SUD susceptibility following TBI has not be investigated. Thus, here we ask the central question of whether the adolescent TBI-induced neuroinflammatory profile at reward centers is divergent in a sex-dependent manner. Using the CPP assay, we found that female mice with high levels of female sex hormones at the time of adolescent TBI demonstrated neuroprotection against increased sensitivity to the rewarding effects of cocaine. These studies also provide evidence of significantly reduced microglial activation and phagocytosis of neuronal proteins within the NAc of females. Overall, our results offer crucial insight into how adolescent TBI impacts the reward pathway in a sex depending manner that could explain a vulnerability to addiction-like behavior.

Examination of sports and recreation-related concussion among youth ages 12-17: results from the 2018 YouthStyles survey	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Concussion; sport; recreation; youth; team	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURIES; UNITED-STATES; LONGITUDINAL TRAJECTORIES; POSTCONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; PARTICIPATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BEHAVIORS; RECOVERY	Background: This paper sought to examine the frequency of self-reported sports- and recreation-related (SRR) concussion, as well as care-seeking behaviors and potential activity restrictions after concussions, in a sample of youth. Methods: A sample of 845 youth ages 12-17 years responded to the web-based YouthStyles survey in 2018. The survey measured the frequency of self-reported lifetime SRR concussion, the setting of their most recent SRR concussion, whether a doctor or nurse evaluated them, and the types of activity restrictions they experienced. Results: Forty-three percent of youth surveyed sustained their most recent concussion while playing on a sports team, 21.1% while playing on a community-based team, and 36.0% while engaged in a sport or recreational activity. Nearly half (45.3%) reported having to miss playing sports or participating in physical activity for at least one day; about two in ten (19.7%) reported having to miss time on their phone or computer for at least one day. Conclusion: Despite wide-spread efforts to promote protocols for SRR concussion among youth, a third of participants in this study did not seek medical care and more than half did not miss at least one day of sports or physical activity participation following a concussion.

Pheochromocytomas (Pheo) and paragangliomas (PGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and from the extra-adrenal autonomic paraganglia, respectively. Only 1-3% of head and neck PGL (HNPGL) show elevated catecholamines, and at least 30% of Pheo and PGL (PCPG) are associated with genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. Clinical Case. A 33-year-old man with a past medical history of resection of an abdominal PGL at the age of eleven underwent a CT scan after a mild traumatic brain injury revealing an incidental brain tumor. The diagnosis of a functioning PGL was made, and further testing was undertaken with a PET-CT with 68Ga-DOTATATE, SPECT-CT 131-MIBG, and genetic testing. Discussion and Conclusion. The usual clinical presentation of functioning PCPG includes paroxistic hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis, sometimes with a suggestive family history in 30-40% of cases. Only 20% of PGL are located in head and neck, of which only 1-3% will show elevated catecholamines. Metastatic disease is present in up to 50% of cases, usually associated with a hereditary germline mutation. However, different phenotypes can be observed depending on such germline mutations. Genetic testing is important in patients with PCPG since 31% will present a germline mutation. In this particular patient, an SDHB gene mutation was revealed, which can drastically influence the follow-up plan and the genetic counsel offered. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for every patient presenting with PCPG.

One of the most common reasons for worsening outcomes following TBI is expanding intracranial haematoma which is compounded by the fibrinolytic physiology that follows TBI. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has a time tested role in preventing poor outcomes linked to excessive haemorrhage in trauma patients. Historically, patients with isolated head trauma were excluded from TXA use due to a theoretical increased risk of thrombosis. Recent evidence that redefines the beneficial role of early TXA administration in preventing mortality amongst patients with TBI is now at hand and offers a real prospect of a pharmacological intervention that would be adopted as a recommendation based on Class l evidence.

We calculated non-invasive equivalents of the pressure reactivity index (PRx) and the pulse amplitude index PAx with slow waves of mean CaBV and its pulse amplitude. Methods About 273 individual TBI patients were retrospectively reviewed. PRx is the correlation coefficient between 30 samples of 10-second averages of ICP and mean ABP. PAx is the correlation coefficient between 30 samples of 10-second averages of the amplitude of ICP (AMP, derived from Fourier analysis of the raw full waveform ICP tracing) and mean ABP. nPRx is calculated with CaBV instead of ICP and nPAx with the pulse amplitude of CaBV instead of AMP (calculated using both the CFF and PFF models). All reactivity indices were additionally compared with Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) to verify potential outcome-predictive strength. Results When correlated, slow waves of ICP demonstrated good coherence between slow waves in CaBV (>0.75); slow waves of AMP showed good coherence with slow waves of the pulse amplitude of CaBV (>0.67) in both the CFF and PFF models. nPRx was moderately correlated with PRx (R = 0.42 for CFF and R = 0.38 for PFF; p < 0.0001). nPAx correlated with PAx with slightly better strength (R = 0.56 for CFF and R = 0.41 for PFF; p < 0.0001). nPAx_CFF showed the strongest association with outcomes. Conclusions Non-invasive estimators (nPRx and nPAx) are associated with their invasive counterparts and can provide meaningful associations with outcome after TBI. The CFF model is slightly superior to the PFF model.

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 941 patients with moderate or severe TBI treated in Daping Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China in a period over 5 years (2013-2017). Only patients with bilateral lesion, the contralateral side being the dominant lesion, and decompressive surgery on the contralateral side conducted firstly were included. Patients were exclude if (1) they underwent bilateral decompression or neurosurgery at the original location firstly; (2) although surgery was performed first on the contralateral side, surgery was done again at the contralateral side due to rebleeding or complications; (3) patients younger than 18 years or older than 80 years; and (4) patients with other significant organ injury or severe disorder or those with abnormal coagulation profiles. Clinical and radiographic variables reviewed were demographic data, trauma mechanisms, neurological condition assessed by Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score at admission, pupil size and reactivity, use of mannitol, time interval from trauma to surgery, Rotterdam CT classification, type and volume of EAH, presence of a skull fracture overlying the EAH, status of basal cistern, size of midline shift, associated brain lesions and types, etc. Patients were followed-up for at least 6 months and the outcome was graded by Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score as favorable (scores of 4-5) and unfavorable (scores of 1-3). Student's t-test was adopted for quantitative variables while Pearson Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also applied to estimate the significance of risk factors. Results: Initially 186 patients (19.8%) with original impact locations at the FTP site and underwent surgery were selected. Among them, 66 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. But only 50 patients were included because the data of the other 16 patients were incomplete. Progressive EAH developed at the original FTP site in 11 patients after the treatment of, with an incidence of 22%. Therefore the other 39 patients were classified as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both the volume of the original hematoma and the absence of an apparent midline shift were significant predictors of hematoma progression after decompressive surgery. Patients with fracture at the original impact site had a higher incidence of progressive EAH after CDS, however this factor was not an important predictor in the multivariate model. We also found that patients with progressive EAH had a similar favorable outcome with control group. Conclusion: Progressive EAH is correlated with several variables, such as hematoma volumes >= 10 mL at the original impact location and the absence of an apparent midline shift (<5 mm). Although progressive EAH is devastating, timely diagnosis with computed tomography scans and immediate evacuation of the progressive hematoma can yield a favorable result.

We aimed to assess the prognostic implication of positive (+ve) Troponins (Tn) measurements by conventional (cTnT) versus High-Sensitivity (HsTnT) assay in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for patients who were admitted with TBI. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, troponin assay results, TBI lesions, and hospital outcomes were analyzed and compared based on troponin assay (cTnT versus HsTnT). RESULTS: across the study period, 654 patients with TBI had troponin levels measured within 24 h postinjury (cTnT=252 and HsTnT=402). The mean age was 31 years and 46% had positive troponins. There were 147 deaths (22.5%); of them 54% had +ve HsTnT, 23% had +ve cTnT, 16% had -ve cTnT and 7% had -ve HsTnT). When the troponins were tested <= 4 h postinjury, the mortality was 10.2% in patients with -ve cTnT and 4% in patients with -ve HsTnT. There was no documented obvious direct trauma to the heart. Overall, patients with positive troponins had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), higher Injury Severity Scores and higher rates of brain edema (P=0.001), pneumonia and sepsis (P=0.001) than those with negative troponin results. In two different models, multivariate regression analysis showed that +ve cTnT and +ve HsTnT were independent predictors of mortality (OR 4.02, 95% CI: 1.72-9.39) and (OR 4.31; 95% CI: 1.76-10.57); respectively, after adjusting for age, injury severity scores, GCS at ED, head AIS, pneumonia, ARDS, surgical interventions, and chest injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although the positivity of any troponin assay is associated with high mortality post-TBI, the use of HsTnT relatively outperforms the conventional troponin assay for early risk stratification and detection of stress-induced myocyte injury in patients with TBI.

The High-Level Mobility Assessment Tool (HiMAT) has excellent interrater and retest reliability and is less susceptible to a ceiling effect than existing mobility scales in children who are 6 to 17 years old and have traumatic brain injury. Objective The purposes of this study were to develop normative HiMAT score ranges for Australian children and to investigate the relationship between children's HiMAT scores and their age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Design This study used a cross-sectional design. Methods Children included in this study were 5 to 12 years old, had no condition affecting their mobility, could follow 2-stage instructions, and had written informed consent from their parent or guardian. A total 1091 children were assessed at their local school, where their height, weight, and HiMAT score were recorded. The relationships between children's age, height, weight, and BMI were summarized using Spearman rank correlations. Truncated regression models were used to determine the most appropriate predictor variable for developing sex-specific normative ranges. Results There was a positive correlation between children's HiMAT scores and their age, height, weight, and BMI. Age explained the most variability in HiMAT scores for both boys and girls. Limitations The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the HiMAT have not been tested across a broad range of children with mobility limitations. Normative data reported in this study are for Australian children only. Conclusions HiMAT scores for children in this study increased with age, height, weight, and BMI. Age was the most appropriate variable for developing a normative dataset of HiMAT scores for children of primary school age.

In this study, we have assessed persons on average 16 years after their injury and determined changes over 6 years in overall outcome, living condition, marital status and vocational situation, and in their functioning and disability. Materials & Methods Individuals (n = 49, mean age 45 years, 28-70 years) who were assessed 6-15 years (average 10 years) post-TBI were reassessed 12-21 years after their injury (average 16 years) using internationally established TBI outcome measures. Results From the first to the second assessment, overall outcome using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was stable for a large majority and no significant changes in marital status or vocational situation were found. There was some significant, but very small, decline regarding cognitive function, home integration and social integration. In the multiple regression analysis, there was a small significant decline in the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4) Adjustment subscale score for women with a moderate-to-severe injury. Conclusions The very small changes over 6 years imply that persons with a TBI can reach and maintain a stable level of functioning many years post-TBI. Women with a moderate-to-severe TBI seem to be more vulnerable and may experience a small decline in some aspects of their functioning related to anxiety, depression, irritability, pain and headache and fatigue. The relatively small sample requires further studies to confirm these findings.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with innominate arterial injuries admitted from January 2016 to July 2018 at the department of vascular surgery, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, China. All the arterial injuries were confirmed by arteriography. Clinical data including mechanism of injury, type of injury, demographics, concomitant injuries, time interval from trauma to blood flow reconstruction, and operation methods were collected. Follow-up program included outpatient visit and duplex-ultrasonography. SPSS version 23.0 was adopted for data analysis. Categorical variables are presented as number and/or frequency and continuous variables as mean +/- standard deviation. Result: Altogether 7 patients were included and 6 (85.7%) were male. The mean age of patients was (29.43 +/- 7.98) years, range 19-43 years. Six patients had isolated innominate arterial injuries and the rest 1 combined innominate arterial and vein injuries. The injury causes were road accidents in 3 patients, stab wound in 2, gunshot wound in 1, and crush injury in 1. All the 7 patients presented hemorrhagic shock at admission, which was timely and effectively corrected. No perioperative death or technical complications occurred. Intimal injury (n = 2) and partial transaction (n = 2) of the innominate artery were treated with covered stents. Two patients with complete transection of artery received vascular reconstruction by artificial grafts. One patient with partial transaction received balloon dilation and open surgical repair (hybrid operation). The mean time interval from trauma to blood flow reconstruction was (4.27 +/- 0.18) h, range 4.0-4.5 h; while the operation time was (48.57 +/- 19.94) min, range 25-75 min. Cerebral infarction occurred in one patient with brain injury due to anticoagulation contraindication. The average follow-up was (13.29 +/- 5.65) months, range 6-24 months. No severe stenosis, occlusion, and thrombosis of covered stents or artificial vessels were found by color Doppler ultrasound. Conclusion: Urgent control of hemorrhage and restoration of blood supply are critical for the treatment of traumatic innominate arterial injury. Endovascular therapy is a feasible and effective method with short operation time and less trauma. (C) 2020 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TBI survivors express degradation in driving abilities, particularly the proactive strategy in which indicators of potentially hazardous situations are sought and identified. The current study examined differences in hazard awareness learning between TBI survivors and noninjured control individuals matched for age and driving experience. Method: Forty individuals equally divided among the 2 groups were assessed by exposure to repetitive video-based hazard scenarios. which have been shown to improve hazard awareness in noninjured individuals. Differences in participants' eye movements and behavioral response while watching video clips of genuine traffic scenes were recorded. Results: Although survivors of TBI demonstrated relatively intact hazard awareness abilities under baseline conditions, they failed to learn from repetitive presentation of the same hazardous situation (i.e., they did not improve hazard detection) and thus failed to adjust their scanning and behavioral reaction (e.g., time to reaction, adapt of scanning behavior). Differences were more prominent for hidden hazards. Our results show impoverished anticipation abilities in driving simulation tasks performed in the subacute recovery phase after TBI and that differences in materialized hazards awareness are distinguishable between TBI survivors and noninjured drivers of similar age and driving experience. Conclusions: Our findings signal the need for further research to clarify the relationship between 'FBI and hazard awareness training that might be supportive of driving rehabilitation after TBI.

It has long been known to have stability issues, specifically, mannitol recrystallises from solutions greater than 10% w/v in ambient conditions. This can happen at any time, whether on the pharmacy shelf or during a medical procedure. This study describes the stability limits of 20% w/v mannitol infusion (the most common strength used clinically) and proposes a number of safer, stable and tuneable hyperosmotic formulations of mannitol in combination with clinically acceptable osmotic agents (NaCl, sorbitol and glycerol).

Physical Performance Measures Correlate with Head Impact Exposure in Youth Football	MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE			English	Article						BIOMECHANICS; HEAD ACCELERATION; STRENGTH; SPEED; FOOTBALL	CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL; BRAIN-INJURY; LATER-LIFE; PLAYERS; ACCELERATION; CONCUSSION; KINEMATICS; MAGNITUDE; RISK	Purpose Head impact exposure (HIE) (i.e., magnitude and frequency of impacts) can vary considerably among individuals within a single football team. To better understand individual-specific factors that may explain variation in head impact biomechanics, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between physical performance measures and HIE metrics in youth football players. Methods Head impact data were collected from youth football players using the Head Impact Telemetry System. Head impact exposure was quantified in terms of impact frequency, linear and rotational head acceleration, and risk-weighted cumulative exposure metrics (RWELinear, RWERotational, and RWECP). Study participants completed four physical performance tests: vertical jump, shuttle run, three-cone, and 40-yard sprint. The relationships between performance measures, and HIE metrics were evaluated using linear regression analyses. Results A total of 51 youth football athletes (ages, 9-13 yr) completed performance testing and received combined 13,770 head impacts measured with the Head Impact Telemetry System for a full season. All performance measures were significantly correlated with total number of impacts in a season, RWELinear-Season, and all RWE-Game metrics. The strongest relationships were between 40-yard sprint speed and all RWE-Game metrics (all P <= 0.0001 and partial R-2 > 0.3). The only significant relationships among HIE metrics in practice were between shuttle run speed and total practice impacts and RWELinear-Practices, 40 yard sprint speed and total number of practice impacts, and three-cone speed and 95th percentile number of impacts/practice. Conclusions Generally, higher vertical jump height and faster times in speed and agility drills were associated with higher HIE, especially in games. Physical performance explained less variation in HIE in practices, where drills and other factors, such as coaching style, may have a larger influence on HIE.

This is quite intriguing as comorbidities are known to increase with advancing age in the donor population. Materials and Methods: We assessed whether age and donor comorbidities influenced liver procurement over a 15-year period in a cohort of 1702 brain-dead donors in Tuscany, Italy. Results: Over the study period, age of potential donors significantly increased (P = .02) as well as the proportion of patients who were > 55 years old. The incidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previously known coronary artery disease also significantly increased. We observed a progressive increase in the number of transplanted livers from donors with advancing age despite an increase in comorbidities. The highest incidences of traumatic brain injury and anoxic brain injury were observed in the youngest donors. Transaminase levels and use of vasoactive drugs were lower in donors who were >= 72 years old. Conclusions: According to our results, criteria for liver donors have already changed. Although age does not seem to be a limiting factor, older donors deserve a more accurate donor selection due to the higher incidence of risk factors (primarily diabetes mellitus).

Neural progenitor/stem cells (NPSCs) that survive in certain parts of the brain, enable brain to produce new neurons and glia. ACTH(4-10)Pro(8)-Gly(9)-Pro(10) has a modulation effect on the expression and activation of the BDNF/TrkB system in the hippocampus area. The BDNF/TrkB pathway system is a potential therapeutic target toward NPSCs proliferation after TBI. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups, i.e A=sham-operated controls; B=TBI; C=TBI+intranasal AACTH(4-10)Pro(8)-Gly(9)-Pro(10) achninistration. After 24 h, rats' brains were immunohistochemically processed, to observe the number of cells expressing mBDNF, TrkB, and SOX2 in the subgranular zone(SGZ) of the hippocampus dentate gyrus(DG). Data were analyzed with SPSS 17, ANOV4, Post Hoc Tukey HSD test, with p value < 0,05. Mean expression of BDNF group C= 16.33 +/- 2.83 increased significantly compared to group A=8.33 +/- 1.32(p=0.0001) and group B=5.89 +/- 1 .69(p=0.0001). Mean expression of TrkB group C=17.00 +/- 1.58 increased significantly compared to group A=4.33 +/- 1.73(p 0.0001) and group B=5.89 +/- 2.47(p=0.0001), TrkB expression in group B increased insignificantly compared to group A (p= 0.234). Mean expression of SOX2 in group C=12.56 +/- 2.07 increased significantly compared to group B = 8.89 +/- 2.318(p=0.0001) and group A=4.89 +/- 2.42(p=0.0001). ACTH(4-10)Pro(8)-Gly(9)-Pro(10) can increase the expression of BDNF and TrkB, and the proliferation of NPSCs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG).

In addition, the diagnostic findings of foveal hypoplasia as seen on optical coherence tomography angiography will be described. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old Caucasian female with history of foveal hypoplasia presented to the clinic for evaluation. She had no other visual, ocular, or systemic complaints. Her ocular history included Duane syndrome, accommodative insufficiency, and traumatic brain injury. Her medical history included cardiac ablation secondary to supraventricular tachycardia, gall bladder removal, maxillary sinus cyst, and a history of migraines. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 in the right and left eyes. Funduscopic examination was unremarkable. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed absence of the anatomical foveal pit with normal inner retinal morphology. Optical coherence tomography angiography confirmed a decreased foveal avascular zone; however, a vascular density analysis showed normal perfusion to the inner retinal plexuses. CONCLUSIONS Optical coherence tomography angiography is a rapid, noninvasive imaging modality that provides excellent insight into the microvasculature supply to the retina and choroid. As such, it allows for an in-depth analysis into the pathophysiology behind certain conditions such as foveal hypoplasia.

Gastrostomy tube placement is a frequently performed procedure in children and has various indications including neurologic impairment. One of the common complications of gastrostomy is granulation tissue formation resulting from chronic irritation. ase presentation: We present the case of 12-years-old Asian male patient that was referred to our hospital as a victim of road traffic accident (RTA) with polytrauma (severe traumatic brain injury, fracture left tibia & fibula). He underwent laparoscopic gastrostomy for long-term feeding. Post tube placement, granulation tissue formed and persisted in spite of multiple silver nitrate cauterization trials necessitating surgical removal. On histopathologic examination of the excised specimen, it was found to harbour schistosoma ova. Conclusion: Gastrostomy tube placement is commonly performed in pediatric cases with serious neurologic insult. Many cases of Schistosoma infestation are asymptomatic. Some cases have atypical presentation includ ing histopathologic diagnosis.

Methods: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was induced by dropping a 200-g weight of steel on the left anterior frontal areas of Sprague-Dawley rats. The synergistic effect of BA and HO was determined by assessing neurological score, as well as parameters of oxidative stress and inflammation, expressions of P2X4 protein and other proteins, and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain tissues of TBI rats. Results: Neurological function score, levels of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress parameters were significantly reduced in rats treated with BA alone, and in those treated with a combination of BA and HO, when compared with untreated TBI rats (p < 0.01). Moreover, treatment with BA alone, and BA-HO combination attenuated the altered protein expressions of P2X4, Akt, PI3K and TLR-4 in the TBI rats, and also upregulated the mRNA expression of P2X4 in the brain tissue, when compared with untreated TBI rats (p < 0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that BA, when used alone or in combination with HO, reduces neuronal injury through upregulation of the protein expression of P2X4 in rats with traumatic brain injury. Thus, BA may be used clinically with HO therapy for the management of traumatic injury.

Oxygenation extremes after traumatic brain injury transiently affect coagulation	THROMBOSIS RESEARCH			English	Article						Coagulopathy; Hypoxia; Hyperoxia; Oxygen; Traumatic brain injury	PLATELET DYSFUNCTION; HYPOXIA; MODEL; ACTIVATION	Introduction: Trauma patients may become hypoxic or iatrogenically hyperoxic in the early post-injury period. While both extremes of oxygenation may be harmful following injury, the mechanism has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesized that hypoxia or hyperoxia would induce changes in coagulation, creating a secondary insult exacerbating the primary injury. Materials and methods: Mice underwent traumatic brain injury (TBI) or sham and were subsequently exposed to room air or brief hypoxia (15% FiO(2)) then sacrificed at intervals. Another cohort of uninjured mice underwent more prolonged hypoxia (10% FiO(2)) or hyperoxia (60% FiO(2)). Platelet function was evaluated by ADP- or ASPi-induced impedance aggregometry and viscoelastic coagulation parameters were assessed with rotational thromboelastometry. Results: In uninjured mice, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was acutely increased after prolonged hypoxia, but this difference did not persist at 6 h. Hypoxic and hyperoxic TBI mice had increased ADP induced platelet aggregation at 1 h compared to the normoxia group. TBI mice demonstrated an early increased platelet aggregation after hypoxia or hyperoxia. Viscoelastic coagulation parameters were similar between hypoxic, hyperoxic and room air groups at 1 h and 6 h. However, ROTEM clotting time and clot formation time were prolonged and maximal clot firmness were lower in sham TBI/hypoxia mice at 24 h. Conclusion: Post-TBI hypoxia and hyperoxia resulted in transiently increased platelet aggregation in response to ADP, without lasting effecting on platelet function or coagulation. Hypoxia also induced delayed hypocoagulability after platelet aggregation normalized. Brief changes in oxygenation may temporally affect coagulation and platelet aggregation, which could contribute to physiologic secondary injury after trauma.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between suicidal ideation (SI), structural brain damage, and cognitive deficits in patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI). Methods. Vietnam War veterans (n = 142) with pTBI to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underwent combination of neuropsychological and psychiatric examinations and non-contrast CT brain scan. Patients were divided into SI positive (SI+) and SI negative (SI-) groups according to the SI item of the Beck Depression Inventory. Results. Lesions to the left rostrolateral PFC (rlPFC) were associated with a lower risk of SI independent of depression and global functioning. Left rlPFC lesion also reduced abstract reasoning skills, which mediated the lesion effects on suicide ideation. Conclusions. The left rlPFC plays a crucial role in SI independently of depression and global functioning.

Risk Factors for Urinary Tract Infection or Pneumonia After Admission for Traumatic Subdural Hematoma at a Level I Trauma Center: Large Single-Institution Series	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Neurosurgical outcomes; Pneumonia; Subdural hematoma; Urinary tract infection	VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; BRAIN-INJURY; DISEASES SOCIETY; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORBIDITY; PROGRAM; ADULTS	BACKGROUND: The development of infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or pneumonia after a traumatic subdural hematoma (tSDH) can worsen patient outcomes and increase healthcare costs. We herein identify clinical parameters that influence the risk of infections after tSDH. METHODS: This single-institution retrospective cohort study examined the incidence and risk factors for UTI and pneumonia among tSDH patients from 1990 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the impact of various demographic and clinical variables on these outcomes. RESULTS: 3024 patients with tSDHs were identified (73.1% male); Of those, 208 (6.9%) experienced a UTI and 434 (14.4%) experienced pneumonia. Of the 559 patients (18.5%) who underwent a craniotomy and/or craniectomy for evacuation of a tSDH, 62 (11.1%) experienced a UTI and 222 (39.7%) experienced pneumonia. Risk factors for both pneumonia and UTI included length of stay (LOS) >= 7 days (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0, P < 0.001; OR = 11.2, P < 0.001), intensive care unit LOS >= 7 days (OR = 8.1, P < 0.001; OR = 1.7, P = 0.012), and mechanical ventilation >= 14 days (OR = 3.4, P < 0.001; OR = 1.8, P = 0.007). Craniotomy/craniectomy increased the risk of pneumonia (OR = 1.4, P = 0.019) but not UTI. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) >= 13 was associated with a decreased pneumonia risk (OR = 0.5, P = 0.003), and male gender (OR = 0.5, P < 0.001) and age <60 (OR = 0.6, P < 0.001) were associated with a decreased UTI risk. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with prolonged hospitalizations and/or intensive care unit stays were more likely to experience UTIs and pneumonia. Male gender and younger age were protective against UTI, and higher GCS was protective against pneumonia. These data may aid the identification and treatment of at-risk populations after admission for a tSDH.

J	Pitt, W; Chou, LS				Pitt, Will; Chou, Li-Shan			A case-control study of gait balance control in veterans with chronic symptoms following mTBI	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; Concussion; Gait balance control; Dual-task; Veterans; Chronic post-concussive syndrome	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DUAL-TASK; DETECTING GAIT; CONCUSSION; STABILITY; RECOVERY; SINGLE; COSTS; RISK; IRAQ	Background: Numerous investigations suggest mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may result in persistent gait balance control deficits. Furthermore, military Veterans with symptoms of chronic mTBI often present with physical symptoms that may be associated with impaired gait balance control which may lead to prolonged recovery, difficulty performing activities of daily living, and increased disability. It is therefore important to objectively quantify gait balance deficits in Veterans with chronic mTBI. Research Question: Is gait balance control impaired in a group of Veterans with chronic symptoms of mTBI when compared to healthy matched Veterans? Methods: Eight Veterans with symptoms of chronic mTBI (1 F/7 M) and eight healthy matched Veterans (1 F/7 M) completed a gait balance assessment under single- (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Gait balance control was quantified with whole body center of mass (COM) total medial-lateral (ML) displacement and peak ML velocity, which were calculated from camera-based motion capture. Results: Veterans with chronic mTBI walked with greater ML COM displacement (approximately 25 % increase) in both ST and DT walking (main effect of group, p = 0.018) when compared to healthy Veterans. The peak ML COM velocity was affected for both groups by performing a concurrent cognitive task (interaction effect, p = .012). Slower ML COM velocities in healthy Veterans suggest the adoption of a conservative balance control strategy, while faster ML COM velocities for Veterans with chronic mTBI may indicate a diminished ability to control ML momentum. Significance: Increased frontal plane COM motion under both ST and DT walking was observed in Veterans with chronic mTBI symptoms many years after injury. This suggests gait balance control may be adversely affected during divided attention gait and highlights the need for comprehensive gait analysis in the management of these individuals.

Methods: An analytical cross sectional study was conducted with 76 informal caregivers of young adults (19 - 50 years) with TBI, using admission records of one of the tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan from 2015 to 2016. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire comprising a general demographic questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire- 28. The effect of the predictors on the psychological distress was determined by applying multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The mean score of the psychological distress was found to be 23.5 +/- 14.28. The findings indicated that anxiety and insomnia, and social dysfunction were the most affected domains of psychological distress; whereas, depression was the least affected. Factors including the management of finances, number of children, patient's gender, and patient's level of disability and lack of socialization were positively associated with the level of distress. As reported by participants, religious beliefs served as a coping mechanism for most of them. Conclusion: The study showed a high level of distress among informal caregivers of young adults with TBI. For recognizing the psychological effects of TBI in patients and their informal caregivers, it is important to initiate and ensure the provision of psychological support to the patients and their families.

The expectation of TBI survivors and family members following rehabilitation are focused on the quality of outcomes such as reintegration into the community, return to work, and maximal functional capacity. Multiple factors may affect recovery after TBI when interacting with the primary condition and predicting the degree of recovery helps in framing realistic goals. The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors influencing the functional outcome in TBI patients at four months post-injury. Methodology: This observational study was carried out in the Neurosurgery outpatient department when TBI patients returned for review at four months post-injury. 50 TBI patients who were able to follow commands participated in this study. Factors like Admission Glasgow coma scale (GCS), Discharge GCS, Length of Hospitalization, Associated fractures of the upper and lower limb, Co-morbid conditions like Diabetes and Hypertension were obtained from the discharge summary of the patient. Caregiver literacy was obtained from the person who took care of the patient completely. Admission CT scan was graded using the Marshall CT classification. Finally, all these factors were compared to the functional status of the patient evaluated using the Barthel Index. Results: Logistic regression was used to predict the factors affecting the functional outcome. Beta value of Caregiver literacy, Discharge GCS, and Co-morbid conditions was .561, .369 and .234, respectively which influences the functional outcome of TBI patients at four months post-injury. Conclusion: The study concludes that caregiver literacy, Discharge GCS, and Co-morbid conditions influence the functional outcome of TBI patients, which emphasizes the need for awareness and education of the caregiver and along with post-discharge rehabilitation program specific exercises addressing the co-morbid conditions would enhance the recovery.

Predictors of Homework Engagement in CBT Adapted for Traumatic Brain Injury: Pre/post-Injury and Therapy Process Factors	COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Brain injury; Cognitive behavior therapy; Homework; Working alliance; Therapist competence; Anxiety; Depression	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; ANXIETY STRESS SCALES; WORKING ALLIANCE; DEPRESSION; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY; INDIVIDUALS; ASSIGNMENTS; DISORDERS; VARIABLES	Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) associated cognitive impairments may pose an obstacle to homework engagement in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety. The current study examined the association of demographic, injury-related and CBT process variables with homework engagement in CBT adapted for TBI -related cognitive impairments (CBT-ABI). The audio-recordings of 177 CBT-ABI sessions, representing 31 therapist-client dyads, were assessed from the independent observer perspective. Client homework engagement, therapist competence in assigning and reviewing homework, and working alliance strength, were measured. Multi-level mixed model regressions showed that older client age, more time since injury, stronger working alliance and greater therapist competence in homework review, were significantly associated with higher levels of homework engagement. The findings highlight how CBT-ABI therapists can possibly enhance homework engagement for clients with TBI.

One risk factor not definitively explored is genetic variation. Genetic variations such as variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in the promotor region are normal in the population, and can lead to disparities in the amount of protein produced, which could be associated with neuronal recovery. Little research has been conducted to investigate promoter VNTRs within genes responsible for recovery following a concussion. The authors implemented a prospective cohort design using a standardized concussion protocol to diagnose and follow 93 athletes to full recovery at three different sites to determine the association between promotor GT(n) VNTR polymorphisms and recovery time within concussed athletes. The GT(n) VNTR within the promoter region of glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type subunit 2A (GRIN2A), potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2), glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 1 (GRIK1), and neurofilament light (NEFL) were genotyped using capillary electrophoresis. GT(n) VNTR promotor polymorphisms were dichotomized into long (L) and short (s) alleles. Using adjusted negative binomial regression models we found that athletes carrying the LL GRIN2A GT(n) VNTR within the promoter region were more likely to experience a prolonged concussion recovery, which resulted in their not being able to return to play for similar to 60 days. Additionally, there was a trend toward significance, in which the ss NEFL GT(n) Caucasian athletes had prolonged concussion recovery. This could presumably be attributed to altered proteins or protein levels that disrupt neuronal recovery. This pilot study suggests that these VNTRs are associated with prolonged concussion recovery. In future studies, we plan to measure the extent to which the L or s alleles alter the level and the activity of the GluNR2a and NEFL proteins that GRIN2A and NEFL produce, respectively.

Design Retrospective review of previously prospectively gathered data. Setting Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. Patients Twenty-three children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in place. Interventions TCD evaluation of the middle cerebral arteries was performed daily. CPP at the time of the TCD examination was recorded. For method 1, estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPe) was calculated as: CPPe = MAP x (diastolic flow (Vd)/mean flow (Vm)) + 14. For method 2, critical closing pressure (CrCP) was identified as the intercept point on the x-axis of the linear regression line of blood pressure and flow velocity parameters. CrCP/CPPe was then calculated as MAP-CrCP. Measurements and main results One hundred eight paired measurements were available. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CPPe was significant (r = 0.78, p = < 0.001). However, on Bland-Altman plots, bias was 3.7 mmHg with 95% limits of agreement of - 17 to + 25 for CPPe. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CrCP/CPPe was significant (r = 0.59, p = < 0.001), but again bias was high at 11 mmHg with wide 95% limits of agreement of - 15 to + 38 mmHg. Conclusions CPPe and CrCP/CPPe do not have clinical value to estimate the absolute CPP in pediatric patients with TBI.

We characterized and described lacrosse-related injuries presenting to United States Emergency Departments (US EDs) using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). From 1997 to 2015, 7,587 lacrosse-related injuries were treated at US EDs (national estimate of 256,358 injuries). Males accounted for 75.5% of injuries. Average age was 16.0 +/- 5.0 (range 5-71) years. Sprains/strains (25.4%), contusions/abrasions (23.9%), and fractures (18.7%) were the most common diagnoses. Females sustained a higher proportion of sprains/strains (36.0%) than males (21.9%) (p< 0.01), while males sustained a higher proportion of fractures (injury proportion ratios [IPR]; 21.3% vs. 10.8%, p< 0.01). Similar proportions of concussions were observed (IPR; 6.1% in males, 6.2% among females). Differences in injury patterns may be secondary to differences in rules and equipment between the two sports.

J	Adjepong, D; Malik, BH				Adjepong, Dennis; Malik, Bilal Haider			Associations and Outcomes Between Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and Vasculitis in Adults Patients	CUREUS			English	Article						chronic traumatic encephalopathy; traumatic brain injury; blood-brain barrier; vasculitis; effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy	BRAIN-INJURY; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT	Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) results from brain injuries and traumas due to accelerated impacts on the head. In severe cases, the diseases cause brain damage, given the head trauma. On the other hand, vasculitis occurs through antibodies that mistake protein vessels as foreign, hence fighting them and resulting in their damage. Examination is usually conducted through blood tests, with antibodies being identified in the antineutrophil cytoplasm. It is unfortunate that its devastating effects also affect the brain of a human, hence leading to dis-functioning. When vasculitis is left untreated, it results in multiple adverse effects on the human body and health both in the short term and in the long term. This study aims to bring to the awareness of neurosurgeons the associations between CTE and vasculitis. This study has proved that there is a close correlation between the progression of CTE and vasculitis. The inflammatory of the blood vessels, as witnessed in vasculitis, increases the risk factors for CTE. The scaling of the vessels and manifestation of different vasculitis conditions in active central nervous system cells results in the worsening of neurodegeneration of the CTE disease.

Gary			A modular impact diverting mechanism for football helmets	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Helmet; Oblique impact; Rotational acceleration; Concussion; Traumatic brain injury	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HEAD IMPACT; CONCUSSION; ACCELERATIONS; PREDICTORS; LOCATION	To mitigate the injurious effect of the rotational acceleration of the brain, a modular Impact Diverting Mechanism (IDM) has been developed. The IDM can replace stickers (decals) that normally attach to the exterior of a football helmet. The IDM decals reduce friction and catch points between the covered area with the IDM on the outer shell of the helmet and the impacting surface, thereby decreasing rotational acceleration acting on the player's head. A Riddell Speed helmet's exterior was prepared with the IDM and outfitted to a headform equipped with linear accelerometers and gyroscopes. The helmets were tested at an impact velocity of 5.5 m/s at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees to the vertical: on the front, side, and back of the helmet. Results of 135 impact tests in the lab show that the IDM decal, when compared to helmets without it, reduced the rotational acceleration, rotational velocity, SI, HIC, and RIC ranging from 22% to 77%, 20% to 74%, 13% to 68%, 7% to 68%, 31% to 94%, respectively. Protection against rotational acceleration from oblique impacts is not prioritized in modern football helmets, as evident by current standard helmet testing protocols. This study demonstrates that the inclusion of the IDM decals in football helmets can help reduce the effects of rotational acceleration of the head during oblique impacts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Children; concussion; disability; education; professional development; school; teacher behaviour; traumatic brain injury	SERVICE DELIVERY; CHILDREN; STUDENTS; SKILLS; TBI; NEEDS; CARE	Educators report a lack of knowledge and preparedness to work with students with traumatic brain injury. A total of 330 Australian educators completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire examining current knowledge of available resources related to traumatic brain injury in their school and community, and educators' perspectives on what additional resources or training would help to improve their capacity to teach students with experience of brain injury. The majority of participants (60%; 197/330) reported that their school did not provide informational resources following a concussive event at school or they were unaware if such information existed. Many participants (40%; 127/315) were not able to identify services within the wider community that could assist and support students with traumatic brain injury. Qualitative analysis indicated that participants were aware of their lack of knowledge regarding traumatic brain injury and wanted access to further training opportunities. Incorporating training on traumatic brain injury into undergraduate teaching curricula and in-service professional development programmes may enhance educators' confidence and capacity to support students with traumatic brain injury in the school environment.

This study attempts to introduce a radiological grading system for temporal lobe contusions and analyse its prognostic value so as to better identify patients at risk of deterioration. Methods The study was conducted as a cross-sectional observational study from April 2011-March 2017 on 42 patients with temporal lobe contusion. Each patients was graded according to the proposed system from a minimum of four to a maximum of 13 and then further grouped in three grades - grade 1 (score = 4), grade 2 (score 5-7) and grade 3 (score > 7) - and their clinical course was closely observed. Results The minimum and maximum scores observed were four and 11 respectively. The proposed grading system has statistically significant correlation to the Glasgow Coma Scale (p-value < 0.05). All patients in grade 1 (17) could be managed conservatively, while all those in grade 3 (five) needed immediate surgical intervention. Of 20 patients in grade 2, 11 had a score of 5-6 and did not require surgery, whereas nine patients had a score of seven and of these eight required delayed surgical intervention. This correlation was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) Conclusion The proposed temporal lobe contusion grading system is a good radiological tool to predict the clinical course of patients and thereby identify patients at higher risk of delayed deterioration.

Responsiveness of a Balance Assessment Using a Mobile Application	SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH			English	Article						postural balance; responsiveness; brain concussion; mobile applications	ERROR SCORING SYSTEM; POSTURAL STABILITY; CONCUSSION; SYMPTOMS	Background: Balance assessment is used by clinicians as part of athlete concussion screening. The King-Devick (K-D) Balance app is designed to provide an objective balance assessment value. The purpose of this study was to investigate the responsiveness of a balance assessment using the K-D Balance app. Hypothesis: The K-D Balance app will demonstrate acceptable responsiveness for balance assessment. Study Design: Repeated-measures study. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Methods: A convenience sample of 25 participants between the ages of 20 and 25 years completed testing procedures. A battery of balance tests using the K-D Balance app on an iPhone were conducted 1 week apart. After a 5-minute warm-up, 3 stances were assessed: double leg, tandem right, and tandem left. The K-D Balance app guided the test positions and test times. A value representing movement was generated by the app algorithm. Analysis included descriptive statistics along with intraclass correlation coefficient and minimal detectable change (MDC). Results: The median score of the K-D test was 0.5 for session 1 and 0.4 for session 2. The ICC was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.04-0.70), and the MDC was 1.58. Conclusion: The MDC value of 1.58 represents the threshold of meaningful change in balance, as measured with the K-D Balance app. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians can use the results of this study to objectively assess changes in balance over time using the K-D Balance app.	[Krause, David A.; Anderson, Sarah E.; Campbell, Graeme R.; Davis, Samson J.; Tindall, Samuel W.; Hollman, John H.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med & Sci, Program Phys Therapy, Rochester, MN USA; [Krause, David A.; Hollman, John H.] Mayo Clin, Phys Med & Rehabil, Rochester, MN USA		Krause, DA (corresponding author), Mayo Sch Hlth Sci, Phys Therapy Program, Siebens Med Educ Bldg 11,200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.	krause.david@mayo.edu	Hollman, John H./AAG-9301-2019				Alberts JL, 2015, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V47, P2233, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000656; Broglio SP, 2009, CLIN J SPORT MED, V19, P377, DOI 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181b625fe; Chang JO, 2014, CLIN J SPORT MED, V24, P256, DOI 10.1097/JSM.0000000000000016; Clark RA, 2010, GAIT POSTURE, V31, P307, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2009.11.012; Covassin T, 2012, AM J SPORT MED, V40, P1303, DOI 10.1177/0363546512444554; Guskiewicz KM, 2001, J ATHL TRAINING, V36, P263; Haley SM, 2006, PHYS THER, V86, P735, DOI 10.1093/ptj/86.5.735; McCrory P, 2013, BRIT J SPORT MED, V47, P250, DOI 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092313; Powers KC, 2014, GAIT POSTURE, V39, P611, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.05.026; Riemann BL, 2000, J ATHL TRAINING, V35, P19; Schmitt JS, 2004, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V57, P1008, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.02.007; SHROUT PE, 1979, PSYCHOL BULL, V86, P420, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.420; Starling AJ., 2015, CONCUSSION, V1, pCNC5; ZHU MQ, 2017, SENSORS BASEL, V17, DOI DOI 10.3390/S17102398	14	0	0	2	3	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1941-7381	1941-0921		SPORTS HEALTH	Sports Health	JUL	2020	12	4					401	404	1941738119888656	10.1177/1941738119888656		JAN 2020	4	Sport Sciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Sport Sciences	ME5JO	WOS:000508784300001	31961240	Green Published			2022-02-07

Design and methods: Data from 94 participants from a longitudinal cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI were analyzed. Socio-demographic and injury severity data were recorded at baseline. Participants completed the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS) at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine PCRS trajectories over time and assess baseline predictors. Results: There was no significant change in average PCRS scores across the follow-up time points in the full sample. Emotional and cognitive competencies had the lowest mean scores. Gender, employment, and the interaction term between gender and time were significant predictors of PCRS trajectories. Females and those who were unemployed at the time of injury showed lower trajectories of self-reported competency. Conclusion: Self-reported competency remained stable from one-year post-injury for men only. Lower mean scores in the domains of emotional and cognitive competencies suggest a need for continued rehabilitation focus in the chronic phase after TBI. Special attention to women and individuals who are unemployed at the time of injury may be warranted.

Validating the usefulness of the NSI validity-10 with the MMPI-2-RF	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mTBI; concussion; Post-concussive Syndrome; NSI; effort; symptom validity; military; veterans	NEUROBEHAVIORAL SYMPTOM INVENTORY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CLINICAL UTILITY; POSTCONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMS; SERVICE MEMBERS; MILITARY; EXAGGERATION; SCALE; VETERANS	Purpose/Aim of the Study: The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) is a 22-item self-report measure created to quantify the somatosensory, cognitive, and affective symptoms of Post-concussive Syndrome. Developers of the NSI used a subset of 10 items, the Validty-10, to measure symptom overreporting. We compared the Validity-10 versus the remaining NSI items (i.e., the Remaining-12) for how accurately they detect symptom exaggeration on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Second Edition - Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF). Materials and Methods: We used a sample of 45 veterans evaluated in a Polytrauma/TBI Clinic of a Midwest VA Healthcare System who completed the NSI and MMPI-2-RF. Results: The Vaidity-10, Remaining-12, and Total Score all strongly correlated with mean of the MMPI-2-RF validity scales (r = .65, .67, and .70, respectively), illustrating equivalency among the various NSI scores. Groups were created based on significant T score elevation on any MMPI-2-RF validity scale (i.e. F-r > 119, or Fp-r, F-s, FBS, or RBS > 99). ROC analyses demonstrated that areas under the curve were equivalent for NSI Total Score (.84), Validity-10 (.81), and Remaining-12 (.81) in detecting overreporting. Conclusions: These findings do not support the notion that the Validity-10 has unique utility as an embedded symptom validity scale and highlights the likelihood that NSI Total Score can also serve this function.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), anoxic encephalopathy, stroke, and brain tumors comprise the majority of the causes of brain death. This study thus aimed is to analyze potential brain deaths and factors associated with organ donation among such patients. Material and methods: Medical records of 629 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with potentially devastating cerebral lesions from 01/2013 to 12/2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and the prevalence of consent for organ donation were then assessed. Results: Although possible brain death was considered in 102 patients, 21 (18%) died before diagnostic tests could be performed. Accordingly, the 81 potential organ donors had a donor conversion rate (DCR) of 30%. Causes of non-organ retrieval among potential donors included refusal of consent by relatives (89.5%), indecision of the family regarding donation or no relatives present (7%), and medical unsuitability for donation (3.5%). Conclusions: Our findings showed that refusal by the family was the most common reason for failure of deceased organ donations. To maximize the number of procured organs, transplant communities need to focus on increasing awareness regarding brain death and organ donation and establish strategies to increase consent obtained from the families.

Information technology and neuroscience make it possible to enhance the diagnostic and rehabilitation process of patients with traumatic brain injury or post-hypoxia. In this paper, we present a new method for evaluation possibility of communication and the assessment of such patients' state employing future generation computers extended with advanced human-machine interfaces. Methods First, the hearing abilities of 33 participants in the state of coma were evaluated using auditory brainstem response measurements (ABR). Next, a series of interactive computer-based exercise sessions were performed with the therapist's assistance. Participants' actions were monitored with an eye-gaze tracking (EGT) device and with an electroencephalogram EEG monitoring headset. The data gathered were processed with the use of data clustering techniques. Results Analysis showed that the data gathered and the computer-based methods developed for their processing are suitable for evaluating the participants' responses to stimuli. Parameters obtained from EEG signals and eye-tracker data were correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and enabled separation between GCS-related classes. The results show that in the EEG and eye-tracker signals, there are specific consciousness-related states discoverable. We observe them as outliers in diagrams on the decision space generated by the autoencoder. For this reason, the numerical variable that separates particular groups of people with the same GCS is the variance of the distance of points from the cluster center that the autoencoder generates. The higher the GCS score, the greater the variance in most cases. The results proved to be statistically significant in this context. Conclusions The results indicate that the method proposed may help to assess the consciousness state of participants in an objective manner.

J	Nan, JC; Zang, J; Gao, MM				Nan Jingchang; Zang Jing; Gao Mingming			Reverse Modeling Method for BRBP Neural Network Power Amplifier Based on Improved Ant Colony Algorithm	LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS			Chinese	Article						optics in computing; neural network inverse modeling; improved ant colony algorithm; Baycsian regularization; L-1/2 regular child; rcconfigurablc power amplifier	TEMPERATURE	Considering the disadvantages of the direct inverse model for the back propagation (BP) neural network, such as low precision, excessive time consumption, and easy to concussion, this paper proposes an inverse modeling method for the BP neural network that combines an improved ant colony algorithm and a Baycsian regularization algorithm. This method improves the ant colony algorithm, which sets the volatilization factor based on the search stage, updates the pheromone based on the degree of pros and cons of the path, and considers the distance between the starting point and the nodes and the distance between the end point and the nodes in the heuristic factor, to optimize the weight of the forward model and improve the accuracy of the overall model. Then the Baycsian regularization algorithm with L-1/2 norm is used to reverse the input of the forward model, which improves the stability of the network. It is applied to a reconfigurable power amplifier. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the method, compared with that of the direct inverse modeling method and the adaptive v inverse modeling method, is improved by 99. 77% and 90. 70%, respectively, with the average running time for the modeling being shorten by 35. 76% and 2. 05%, respectively. Thus, the complexity of designing a power amplification module is reduced and its design speed is accelerated.

There is limited empirical guidance for determining restorability of defendants, and legislators have little data to support their decision-making regarding statutory changes to limit the period of attempted restoration for defendants. This study examined whether commonly available demographic and clinical information predicts non-restorability in hospitalized felony criminal defendants who are refractory to early interventions at restoration. Archival data from a quality assurance State Hospital, database such as demographic and clinical variables for 271 cases were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. Lower likelihood of restoration was significantly associated with the presence of a developmental disorder, traumatic brain injury/neurological disorder, cognitive disorder, older age, and length of restoration effort. Among defendants who can attain competency to stand trial, 96% do so by the 60th treatment month. Findings indicate that restoration efforts are largely unsuccessful afterward, which suggests that readily available clinical and demographic variables can be used to reasonably predict restoration. These findings add empirical support and guidance to determining non-restorability among defendants.

The aim of this study was to translate, validate and conduct a reliability test of the CIQ-R Malay version. The development involved the three phases of translation, content validation and cognitive interviewing, test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the CIQ-R Malay version. The Content Validity Index (CVI) showed perfect agreement between the panel experts. The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) demonstrated a moderate to excellent level of test-retest agreement (ICC 0.72 to 0.93). The Total CIQ-R Malay version and Home Integration subscale showed good internal consistency, with values of Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.81 to 0.90. The findings from the present study provided preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the CIQ-R Malay version as a valid and reliable instrument to be used in Malaysia.

J	Keough, L; Gardner, S; Kirby, A				Keough, Lori; Gardner, Susan; Kirby, Alyssa			Development and Implementation of a Brain Rest Protocol in Nonintellectually Challenged Youth With Head-Banging Behaviors	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC NURSES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						head banging; brain concussion; self-injurious behavior; nursing assessment; psychiatric nursing		INTRODUCTION: Concussions as a result of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in youth are often associated with athletic injury; however, they can also occur as a result of intentional self-injury by head banging. Despite the known neurological sequelae secondary to MTBI, assessment, interventions, and consequences of head banging in the nonintellectually disabled populations have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: The intent of this nurse-led intervention was to develop a brain rest protocol at a residential treatment program serving youth who were between 12 and 19 years old in order to improve the quality of care and moderate negative sequelae resulting from MTBI. METHOD: A nursing assessment guided by an adaptation of the acute concussion evaluation and a strength-based intervention protocol was developed and applied to youth who engage in head banging. RESULTS: The result was a protocol that defined the process by which a youth would be assessed and treated after head banging. There are no outcome measures that would assist to measure the effectiveness of this intervention in the short or long term. CONCLUSION: This intervention filled a need for improved assessment and appropriate interventions in youth with head-banging behavior. It is feasible that the assessment and implementation of the brain rest protocol is the first step in understanding how to best evaluate and manage the sequelae of intentional head banging resulting from MTBI.

J	Richardson, BK				Richardson, Belinda K.			Promoting functional seated positioning and communication utilising a custom cervical and trunk orthosis in severe traumatic brain injury: a case report	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Orthosis; traumatic brain injury; positioning; communication; posture	AUGMENTATIVE COMMUNICATION; SCOLIOSIS; ACCESS; COMA	Background and Purpose: Published evidence to guide therapists regarding positioning strategies for patients with TBI is limited. This case report describes the development of a custom cervical-thoracic-lumbar orthosis to improve functional seated positioning and communication for an individual with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Case description: A man in his 20 s admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital nine weeks after sustaining a TBI. Upon admission, he presented in a vegetative state with severe positioning and postural impairments. Intervention: Despite evidence of cognitive progression at 7 weeks post-admission, the patient demonstrated persistent postural deficits and limitations in functional activities and communication. To provide additional postural support, a custom cervico-thoracic-lumbar orthosis was fabricated to promote improved function and communication. Outcomes: From the time of admission to post-admission weeks 7-8, the patient progressed on multiple measures: Rancho Los Amigos scale: level II to level VII; Coma Recovery Scale Revised 6 points to 15 points; Disability Rating Scale decreased from 25 points to 12 points. Functional Independence Measure 20 points at 6 weeks post-admission to 23 points at 8 weeks post-admission. Discussion: Custom cervico-thoracic-orthoses may provide additional postural support to promote improved function in individuals post-TBI. Further studies are needed to provide evidence of custom orthoses' effect on function and communication in this population.

Mild TBI (mTBI) makes up approximately 80% of reported cases and often results in transient psychological abnormalities and cognitive disruption. At-risk populations for mTBI include athletes and other active individuals who may sustain repetitive concussive injury during periods of exercise and exertion when core temperatures are elevated. Previous studies have emphasized the impact that increased brain temperature has on adverse neurological outcomes. A lack of diagnostic tools to assess concussive mTBI limits the ability to effectively identify the post-concussive period during which the brain is uniquely susceptible to damage upon sustaining additional injury. Studies have suggested that a temporal window of increased vulnerability that exists corresponds to a period of injury-induced depression of cerebral glucose metabolism. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between repetitive concussion, local cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain temperature using the Marmarou weight drop model to generate mTBI. Animals were injured three consecutive times over a period of 7 days while exposed to either normothermic or hyperthermic temperatures for 15 min prior to and 1 h post each injury. A C-14-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) autoradiography was used to measure local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (lCMR(Glc)) in 10 diverse brain regions across nine bregma levels 8 days after the initial insult. We found that repetitive mTBI significantly decreased glucose utilization bilaterally in several cortical areas, such as the cingulate, visual, motor, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in subcortical areas, including the caudate putamen and striatum, compared to sham control animals. lCMR(Glc) was significant in both normothermic and hyperthermic repetitive mTBI animals relative to the sham group, but to a greater degree when exposed to hyperthermic conditions.

Due to the vast variability in the types and severity of trauma, the cellular consequences of head injury are not completely understood. The development of reliable models of TBI will aid in understanding the molecular consequences of head trauma, and they will assist in identifying biological surrogate markers of the degree of damage and prognosis. In doing so, effective therapeutic strategies can be applied. Current in vivo experimental models yield important information, but they too have a significant amount of variation. The goal of this review is to re-evaluate the use of these in vivo models of TBI and assess whether they correlate with the consequence of TBI in humans from the perspective of tau, an axonal microtubule-stabilizing protein. We present and discuss the current models of traumatic head injury, and we focus on those that assess changes in tau. We evaluate reports of TBI in humans that measured changes in tau and that were detectable in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and as a pathological consequence in brain tissue.

J	Acharya, U; Lamsal, R				Acharya, Utsav; Lamsal, Ritesh			Ankle Surgery in a Patient with Acute Subdural Hematoma Under Combined Lumbar Plexus and Proximal Sciatic Nerve Block - A Case Report	LOCAL AND REGIONAL ANESTHESIA			English	Article						intracranial hemorrhage; regional anesthesia; traumatic brain injury; ultrasound		Acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) is commonly encountered in the emergency department in patients with traumatic injuries. If the hematoma is small, non-expanding and asymptomatic, it is managed conservatively. However, other injuries sustained during trauma may warrant surgical intervention, during which anesthetic management becomes challenging. There have been reports of rebleeding in patients with aSDH after undergoing surgery under either general or spinal anesthesia. Here we present a case where ankle surgery for trimalleolar fracture was successfully performed in a patient with traumatic aSDH under combined lumbar plexus and proximal (para-sacral) sciatic nerve block.

It can additionally provide another platform by which we can characterize the injury and its associated symptoms, especially in the chronic condition. Methods We examined the changes in cortical thickness and diffusion properties in white matter tracts in 51 patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or self-report chronic symptoms. Results Significant cortical thinning was observed in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe for TBI patients with chronic symptoms, but not for TBI patients without chronic symptoms, compared with control group. Significant reduction in fractional anisotropy occurred on average across left and right major fiber tracts for TBI patients with chronic symptoms. No mean diffusivity changes were found in any individual white matter tract for TBI patients with or without chronic symptoms. Conclusions Traumatic brain injury patients with chronic symptoms have more significant cortical thinning or degeneration of diffusion properties than the mild to severe TBI patients without chronic symptoms.

The aim of this study was evaluating the effect of a high protein diet on the dietary factors, clinical outcome, and mortality rate of neurocritical patients. In a randomized controlled trial, 15 neurocritical patients were recruited in each group. The patients in the intervention and control groups received high protein and conventional protein regimens, respectively. The Clinical Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) measured at one, two, and three months later. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, Glasgow Coma Scale, the serum level of transthyretin (TTR) on the first, 3rd and fifth days of admission, and nitrogen balance (NB) at the baseline and fifth day of the study were recorded. Thirty patients, 15 in each group, entered into the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the patients between the two groups of the study. The 28-days-mortality rate in the intervention and control group were 33.3% (n = 5) and 73.3% (n = 11), P-value = 0.034, respectively. The GOSE scores were higher in the patients who received a high protein diet, and lower in the patients with lower baseline TTR, higher APACHE-II score, older age, and a baseline negative nitrogen balance. The high protein diet may decrease the mortality rate, and improve the clinical outcome of neurocritical patients. The baseline TTR level, APACHE II score, and NB are prognostic factors for the prediction of the GOSE in neurocritical patients.

Perfusion Neuroimaging Abnormalities Alone Distinguish National Football League Players from a Healthy Population	HANDBOOK OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION	Advances in Alzheimers Disease		English	Article; Book Chapter						Brain imaging; cognition; concussion; football; NFL; SPECT; traumatic brain injury	CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; NFL PLAYERS; BRAIN; ATROPHY; CONCUSSIONS; PATTERNS; BATTERY; DISEASE	Background: National Football League (NFL) players are exposed to multiple head collisions during their careers. Increasing awareness of the adverse long-term effects of repetitive head trauma has raised substantial concern among players, medical professionals, and the general public. Objective: To determine whether low perfusion in specific brain regions on neuroimaging can accurately separate professional football players from healthy controls. Method: A cohort of retired and current NFL players (n = 161) were recruited in a longitudinal study starting in 2009 with ongoing interval follow up. A healthy control group (n = 124) was separately recruited for comparison. Assessments included medical examinations, neuropsychological tests, and perfusion neuroimaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Perfusion estimates of each scan were quantified using a standard atlas. We hypothesized that hypoperfusion particularly in the orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, hippocampal, amygdala, insular, caudate, superior/mid occipital, and cerebellar sub-regions alone would reliably separate controls from NFL players. Cerebral perfusion differences were calculated using a one-way ANOVA and diagnostic separation was determined with discriminant and automatic linear regression predictive models. Results: NFL players showed lower cerebral perfusion on average (p < 0.01) in 36 brain regions. The discriminant analysis subsequently distinguished NFL players from controls with 90% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 94% accuracy (95% CI 95-99). Automatic linear modeling achieved similar results. Inclusion of age and clinical co-morbidities did not improve diagnostic classification. Conclusion: Specific brain regions commonly damaged in traumatic brain injury show abnormally low perfusion on SPECT in professional NFL players. These same regions alone can distinguish this group from healthy subjects with high diagnostic accuracy. This study carries implications for the neurological safety of NFL players.

Recent studies have reported the frequency of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among trauma patients. Adult AD0HD has been reported in trauma patients. In the present study, we hypothesized that adult ADHD was more common among head trauma patients following an accident compared to a group without trauma. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 230 patients with head injuries and 460 non-trauma patients were selected. The adult Connors self-report screening scale (CAARS-SV) was used to screen for ADHD. Three subscales as subscale A (attention deficit index), subscale B (hyperactivity index) and subscale D (ADHD index) were evaluated between the two groups. Using linear multiple regression analysis, the effect of group, age, gender, and socioeconomic variables on ADHD scores was evaluated. Results: The total frequency of adult ADHD was 9.5%, which was equal to 1.6% in the trauma group and 9.5% in the non-trauma group. The experimental group had more drivers as the job (11.7% vs 3.7%, P<0.001) compared to the control group. Of the Connors subscales, only the D subscale was significantly lower in the case group than in the control group (6.35 6 5.11 vs 51.72 4 72.4, P=0.003). The prevalence of ADHD in patients with head trauma and non-trauma head injury was 6.1% and 5.9%, respectively, which did not show a statistically significant difference (P=0.9). Linear regression analysis showed that the subscale D only had a significant relationship with group and age. However, by entering variables in logistic regression analysis, it was observed that only the age variable was significant in the presence of other variables. Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, the frequency of adult ADHD in trauma patients, as a screening diagnosis, was not found to be higher than non-traumatic patients.

A previous study established a scoring system for patients with mild TBI that assigned <3 points for the low-risk group, 3-6 points for the moderate-risk group, and <greater than or equal to>6 points for the high-risk group. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the external validity of mild TBI risk scores for predicting intracranial hemorrhage in patients with mild TBI who had been transferred to receive a brain CT scan at the 10 nationwide CT scan-capable facilities in Thailand.MethodsThe study was a retrospective cross-sectional review of patients with mild TBI who received a brain CT scan in 10 nationwide hospitals of Thailand. Risk factors were observed and points calculated for predicting mild TBI scores based on patient records. Injured patients were divided into two groups: CT scans indicating normal and abnormal brain images. After this, the accuracy of mild TBI score for predicting the presence of intracranial hemorrhage was investigated.ResultsThe study included a total of 999 patients, comprising 461 (46.15%) patients with abnormal brain CT scans indicating intracranial hemorrhage and 538 (53.85%) indicating no intracranial hemorrhage. In the low-risk group (mild TBI risk score <3), moderate-risk group (mild TBI risk score 3-6), and high-risk group (mild TBI risk score >6), the likelihood ratio positive of brain CT scans were 0.41, 3.53, and 77.3, respectively.DiscussionMild TBI risk score may assist healthcare providers to select patients with mild TBI for brain CT scan referral, particularly in hospitals without CT scan facilities. In such cases, based on the proposed scoring system, immediate transfer of moderate-risk and high-risk patients with mild TBI to a CT scan-capable facility is necessary.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the GCS and RCTS components can be used to predict outcomes in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (IH) after TBI. Patients and Methods: Between May 2009 and July 2017, 773 patients with IH after TBI were retrospectively reviewed. Data on initial GCS, RCTS according to initial brain CT, and status at hospital discharge and last follow-up were collected. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between GCS and RCTS components with outcomes after TBI. Results: Among the 773 patients, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 14.0%. Variables independently associated with outcomes were the verbal (V-GCS) and motor components of GCS (M-GCS), epidural mass lesion (E-RCTS) and intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage components of RCTS (H-RCTS) (p < 0.0001). The new TBI score was obtained with the following calculation: [V-GCS + M-GCS] [E-RCTS + H-RCTS]. Conclusion: The new TBI score includes both clinical status and radiologic findings from patients with IH after TBI. The new TBI score is a useful tool for assessing TBI patients with IH in that it combines the GCS and RCTS components that increases area under the curve for predicting in-hospital mortality and unfavorable outcomes and eliminates the paradoxical relationship with outcomes which was observed in GCS score. It allows a practical method to stratify the risk of outcomes after TBI.

The following instruments were used: The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (adapted in Russian), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Recovery Locus of Control, Psychological General Well-Being Index, MMSE (Mini - Mental State Examination), Luria Test, Shulte Tables. Our main findings were as follows: average age of the group was 38.7 +/- 11.1 years against the mean duration of pain 10.8 +/- 4.7 years. Gross cognitive deficits were reported in 5 (26.3%) men with severe brain injuries. An increased level of anxiety was found in 6 (31.6%) whereas clinical depression was diagnosed in 7 men. Thus, different types of cephalgia are attributed to the presence and various rates of anxiety, depression and cognitive disorders.

Comparison of immunological, histological and oxidative effects of felbamate and levetiracetam in traumatic brain injury	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Head trauma; Felbamate; Levetiracetam; Rat	PROTECTION; THERAPY; MODEL	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare immunological, histological and oxidative effects of antiepileptic agents; felbamate and levetiracetam on head trauma in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 32 Sprague-Dawley genus male rats were used. A closed head trauma mechanism was constituted in order to perform head trauma in rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups, and each group had 8 rats. Following head trauma, Group 1 (Control); normal saline was administered, Group 2; levetiracetam 50 mg/kg was administered, Group 3; felbamate 100 mg/kg was administered, and Group 4; levetiracetam 50 mg/kg and felbamate 100 mg/kg were administered with a combination. Injections were administered intraperitoneally once a day for 20 days. The rats were decapitated at the end of the 20th day. Blood and tissue samples were collected and analyzed for biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological parameters. RESULTS: Serum cytokine levels in Group 2, 3 and 4 were lower when compared to the control group. In Group 4, in which combined therapy was performed, cytokine levels were found to be the lowest. In Groups 2 and 3, a significant decrease in vascular congestion, mononuclear cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and neural degeneration was noticed in the pia mater. In Group 2, a decrease in vascular congestion and Purkinje cell degeneration was obtained in the cerebellum. However, the best outcomes were determined in Group 4. CONCLUSIONS: We determined that levetiracetam and felbamate alone are useful with respect to immunological, oxidative and histological alterations. However, their utility is better when used in a combination.	[Bayhan, I; Turtay, M.

Common indications for surgical intervention include cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Dorsal rhizotomy involves transecting sensory lumbar and sacral nerve roots to reduce excitatory input to the spinal cord, thereby decreasing spasticity and improving motor function in the lower limbs. Unlike rhizotomy, an ablative procedure, intrathecal baclofen therapy is a procedure with reversible therapeutic effects. It requires permanent implantation of a lumbar-subarachnoid catheter and a subcutaneous pump apparatus that can deliver baclofen, a GABA-B agonist that increases the inhibitory effect interneurons on motor neurons, thus decreasing tone. Both procedures can have serious adverse effects that can either be severely debilitating or even fatal. Therefore, meticulous patient selection involving a thorough pre-operative evaluation by experienced clinicians is crucial, ideally utilizing a multidisciplinary approach to maximize the success of these surgical procedures and minimize complications.

Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty patients who were diagnosed as having PI between 2012 and 2018 (53.3% female, mean age 48.13 +/- 15.83 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Age at diagnosis was higher in females as compared with males (51.13 +/- 15.95 vs. 44.70 +/- 15.08 years, P 0.012). The most frequent presenting signs were headache (29.4%) and visual disturbance (19.6%) in general. Females frequently presented with headache (33.3%), whereas males presented with sexual dysfunction (34.4%). 'the most frequent cause of PI was nonfunctional pituitary adenoma (28.8%) in general population. A frequent cause of PI was Sheehan's syndrome (33.8%) among females and nonfunctional pituitary adenoma (38.6%) among males. Pituitary macroadenoma (75.8%) was frequent in pituitary tumors with PI. 55.3 % of the patients had 4 pituitary hormones deficiencies and 26.0% of patients had 3 pituitary hormones deficiencies. Gonadotropin deficiency was the leading pituitary hormone deficiency. The frequency of posttraumatic PI was 4.7% in the general population. Conclusion: Nonfunctional pituitary adenoma was the most common cause of PI among males and Sheehan's syndrome was a major etiologic factor in females. Sheehan's syndrome remains an important health problem in Turkey although obstetric care has improved. Posttraumatic PI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic PI.

Also pervasive in adolescents is recreational cannabis use. Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, is known to have anti-inflammatory properties and serves as a neuroprotective agent against excitotoxicity. Thus, we investigated the effects of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol on recovery when administered either prior to or following repeated mild brain injuries. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol or vehicle either prior to or following the repeated injuries. Rats were then tested on a behavioural test battery designed to measure post-concussive symptomology. The hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex were extracted from all animals to examine mRNA expression changes (Bdnf, Cnr1, Comt, GR, Iba-1 and Vegf-2R). We hypothesized that, in both experiments, Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol administration would provide neuroprotection against mild injury outcomes and confer therapeutic benefit. Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol administration following repeated mild traumatic brain injury was beneficial to three of the six behavioural outcomes affected by injury (reducing anxiety and depressive-like behaviours while also mitigating injury-induced deficits in short-term working memory). Delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol administration following injury also showed beneficial effects on the expression of Cnr1, Comt and Vegf-2R in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. There were no notable benefits of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol when administered prior to injury, suggesting that Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol may have potential therapeutic benefit on post-concussive symptomology when administered post-injury, but not pre-injury.

It is based on a case study which was prepared and positively evaluated in 2017 as part of a specialisation exam in the field of clinical psychology and neuropsychology as a subspecialisation. The purpose of this paper was to present an exam case study, which may be helpful for those preparing for a specialisation exam in the field of clinical psychology, based on neuropsychological diagnostic process. Guidelines for the preparation of examination case study are available on the website of the National Consultant and Voivodship Consultants in Clinical Psychology (http://psychologiakonsultanci.pl).

Amygdala response to emotional faces in adolescents with persistent post-concussion symptoms	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Concussion; Mild traumatic brain injury; Emotional face processing; Amygdala; fMRI	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR; READING EMOTIONS; EXPRESSION; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; SPORT; FMRI	Approximately 30% of adolescents with concussion develop persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) that include emotional symptoms. Elevated amygdalae reactivity to emotional faces has been reported in a variety of psychopathologies characterized by emotional symptoms overlapping with those in PPCS. We tested the hypothesis that amygdalae reactivity to emotional faces in adolescents with PPCS + is elevated compared to concussed adolescents without PPCS and healthy controls. Concussed adolescents (ages 14-18) with (PPCS +; n = 23) and without PPCS (PPCS-; n = 13) participated in visits at least 4 weeks post-injury. Adolescents without prior concussion served as controls (HC; n = 15). All participants completed a detailed clinical battery and a common emotional face processing task that involved matching of emotional faces or shapes. Compared to HC and PPCS-, adolescents with PPCS + had elevated depression symptoms, anhedonia, general psychological symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Contrary to our hypothesis, PPCS + had lower amygdalae activity to the emotional faces versus shapes condition relative to HC and a trend for lower activity relative to PPCS-. There was a non-significant inverse association between anhedonia amygdalae activity in adolescents with PPCS. Results suggest that adolescents with PPCS have altered amygdalae activity during the processing of emotional face stimuli.

Acute-on-chronic subdural cranial hematoma in a dog: case report	ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA			English	Article						canine; head trauma; traumatic brain injury; computed tomography	CT	A ten-month-old male Yorkshire terrier dog was evaluated via CT four months after traumatic brain injury. The head CT scan showed dilated ventricles associated with a peripheral crescent-shaped collection of blood near the right parietal bone with a mineralized area. The visceral layer of the hematoma was hyperattenuating on the native scan and showed moderate contrast enhancement after administration of intravenous iodinated contrast medium. No fractures were identified in the calvarium. These findings were compatible with acute-on-chronic calcified subdural hematoma, which have been described with more detail in humans. This is the first report to include the description of the imaging findings related to this condition using computed tomography in a dog.	[Bonelli, M. A.; Silva, I. C. C.; Costa, F.

George			Chronic decompression illness cognitive dysfunction improved with hyperbaric oxygen: a case report	UNDERSEA AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE			English	Article						air embolism; altitude; ANAM; brain; case reports; cognitive; decompression illness; hyperbaric oxygen therapy	POST-CONCUSSION SYNDROME; WHITE-MATTER; INJURY; ANAM	Introduction: Altitude chamber exposures are used for training to allow aircrew to experience their hypoxia and pressure effect symptoms. Decompression illness (DCI) can occur subsequent to altitude chamber training or in operational aircraft when the cabin altitude is at least 18,000 feet. Definitive emergent treatment is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) to decrease bubble size, dissipate excess nitrogen hyperoxygenate tissue and reduce inflammation. Case report: A 27-year-old female underwent altitude chamber training to 25,000 feet. She developed tingling in both legs and left arm, headache, dizziness, malaise, then difficulty talking. She underwent two HBO2 treatments. Over the next 12 months she had paresthesia, decreased memory and cognitive function similar to symptoms seen following traumatic brain injury. She was referred 14 months after the event for evaluation. Using pre-deployment Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) and serial tests over 58 HBO2 treatments, the patient demonstrated near-return to her pre-deployment test scores. Discussion: The reason for HBO2 treatment was based on previous experience with chronic traumatic brain injury subjects where HBO2 improved outcome. The patient's chronic neurological symptoms mimicked chronic TBI. The patient was unique in that baseline cognitive tests existed that could be used to monitor her changes during the treatment series.

J	Braganza, J; Pratt, A				Braganza, Joshua; Pratt, Abimbola			Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the setting of trauma: A case report	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES); Intracranial hypertension; Traumatic brain injury; Neuroimaging; Trauma		Reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in the setting of trauma and acute care surgery are scarce. PRES presents rapidly with a variety of symptoms including headaches, visual disturbances, altered consciousness, and seizures. It is associated with acute hypertensive episodes. PRES is diagnosed with a specific neuroimaging pattern and a constellation of clinical symptoms. This case report presents two traumatically injured patients with one confirmed case of PRES and the other with a potential case of PRES. The diagnosis was made through neuroimaging showing patchy T2 and diffusion hyperintensity in the periphery of both occipital lobes and adjacent cerebellar hemispheres on MRI in one case. The other case highlights extensive stable white matter disease without evidence of acute infarct on MRI, as well as diminished attenuation within the cerebral white matter in the occipital lobes on CT scan. There was resolution of visual symptoms in one patient while the other patient's neurologic status did not allow for evaluation of symptom resolution. This report aims to emphasize the possibility of PRES in trauma patients with a specific pattern of neuroimaging and clinical symptoms, and to increase the index of suspicion in acute care providers.

We previously reported that resuscitation fluid with drag reducing polymers (DRP-RF) improves CBF by theological modulation of hemodynamics. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of DRP-RF, compared to lactated Ringers resuscitation fluid (LR-RF), in reducing cerebral microthrombosis and reperfusion mitochondrial oxidative stress after TBI complicated by HS. Fluid percussion TBI (1.5 ATA, 50 ms) was induced in rats and followed by controlled HS to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg. DRP-RF or LR-RF was infused to restore MAP to 60 mmHg for 1 h (pre-hospital period), followed by blood reinfusion to a MAP = 70 mmHg (hospital period). In vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy over the parietal cortex was used to monitor microvascular blood flow, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) for tissue oxygen supply and mitochondrial oxidative stress (superoxide by i.v. hydroethidine [HEt], 1 mg/kg) for 4 h after TBI/HS, followed by Dil vascular painting during perfusion-fixation. TBI/HS decreased mCBF resulting in capillary microthrombosis and tissue hypoxia. Microvascular CBF and tissue oxygenation were significantly improved in the DRP-RF compared to the LR-RF treated group (p < 0.05). Reperfusion-induced oxidative stress, reflected by HEt fluorescence, was 32 +/- 6% higher in LR-RF vs. DRP-RF (p < 0.05). Post-mortem whole-brain visualization of DiI painted vessels revealed multiple microthromboses in both hemispheres that were 29 +/- 3% less in DRP-RF vs. LR-RF group (p < 0.05). Resuscitation after TBI/HS using DRP-RF effectively restores mCBF, reduces hypoxia, microthrombosis formation, and mitochondrial oxidative stress compared to conventional volume expansion with LR-RF.

The Neuropathological and Clinical Diagnostic Criteria of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Critical Examination in Relation to Other Neurodegenerative Diseases	HANDBOOK OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION	Advances in Alzheimers Disease		English	Article; Book Chapter						Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; concussion; football; neurodegenerative diseases; sports; traumatic brain injury	BODIES DLB REPORT; LEWY BODIES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS; PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIA; CONSENSUS GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; BODY; CONSORTIUM; ACCURACY	This work critically reviews chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with a specific focus on the single criterion necessary and sufficient for diagnosis. Herein, CTE is compared to other well-established neurodegenerative entities including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Each neurodegenerative disorder is reviewed in five pertinent areas: 1) historical perspective, 2) guideline formation process, 3) clinical diagnostic criteria, 4) pathological diagnostic criteria, and 5) validation of previously described diagnostic criteria (e.g., sensitivity and specificity). These comparisons indicate that CTE is a disease in the earliest stages of formation and has yet to undergo rigorous development and refinement similar to other neurodegenerative diseases. Suggested future revisions to the diagnostic criterion of CTE include establishing a lower threshold for accumulation of pathology, as well as accounting for the presence of concomitant neuropathology and comorbid neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, while initial efforts have been attempted, agreed upon antemortem clinical criteria do not exist. As has been the scientific standard with similar neurodegenerative disorders, antemortem diagnostic guidelines should first be refined through subcommittees of neuroscientists from diverse institutional backgrounds with a subclassification of levels of diagnostic certainty (possible, probably, and definite). Validation studies should then assess the predictive value and accuracy of proposed antemortem diagnostic criteria in relation to potential pathological criteria.

Methods: A quasi-experimental, before-and-after study with a single comparison group. Descriptive statistics and McNemar's test were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention. Results: This study had the participation of 162 higher education professionals, predominantly teachers (82.1%), female (97.5%), aged over 40 (69.2%). An increase in correct answers was observed, with statistical significance (<= 0.05), especially in proper handling in case of fall with traumatic brain injury, electric shock, and burn due to hot liquid (98.1%, 98.1% and 96.9% of proper response, respectively). Conclusions: First aid training for child accidents, through content exhibition, in a dialogical and practical way, proved to be efficient for multidisciplinary teams from special education schools for people with disabilities.

J	Caamano, P; Leiva, S; Ferreres, A				Caamano, Paula; Leiva, Samanta; Ferreres, Aldo			Empathy impairments and its relation to behavior in patients with traumatic brain injury: A systematic review	CUADERNOS DE NEUROPSICOLOGIA-PANAMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			Spanish	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Social cognition; Empathy; Behavior; Systematic review	BLUNT HEAD-INJURY; INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; PERSONALITY-CHANGE; SPANISH VERSION; SELF-AWARENESS; RECOGNITION; EMOTION; ASSOCIATION; DEFICITS	The aim of this article was to examine the relation between empathy and behavior impairments in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methodology: We performed a systematic review of the available literature until February 2018, using several databases. We searched for original articles that assessed empathy and/or behavior in adult patients with TBI. Results: The literature search yielded 1731 articles, only 19 of which were included in this review. All studies, except one, reported a decrease in empathic response and behavior impairments in patients with TBI. Only two articles examined the relation between both deficits directly, showing that impairments in empathic response were associated with impairments in social behavior. Conclusion: Even though empathy and behavior impairments are widely described in TBI population, the amount of studies that examine the relation between the two are few. This exposes the need to widen the research on this topic to know more precisely to which extent empathy deficits impact upon patient's daily life.

Methods: This study prepared the weight drop/impact acceleration-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in rats, including sham group and TBI groups at different observation time points (6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days after TBI). The dynamic expression of PDGF-D and p-PDGFR-beta after TBI were detected by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Results: The expression level of PDGF-D and p-PDGFR-beta after TBI was detected by western blot. The PDGF-D level was increased (p < 0.05) 6 hours after TBI and remained at the high level until 3 days after TBI (p < 0.05). The p-PDGFR-beta level was increased (p < 0.05) 12 hours after TBI and remained at the high level until 3 days after TBI (p < 0.05). PDGF-D and p-PDGFR-beta in brain tissues were found by immunofluorescence in the perihematoma area 24 hours after TBI. Conclusions: This study revealed the expression phenomenon of PDGF-D and p-PDGFR-beta after TBI in rats, suggesting that PDGF-D participates in the process of secondary brain injury after TBI through specific binding with PDGFR-beta, which provides a theoretical basis for further research on selecting therapeutic targets and intervention times after TBI.

In recent decades, however, macroscale brain imaging methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have facilitated a wider scope of understanding neural structure and function across the lifespan. Thanks to such methods, a broader picture of the relationship between microscale processes-studied by neurobiologists-and macroscale observations-made by clinicians-has emerged. More recently, the vascular component of neurodegeneration has come under renewed scrutiny partly due to increased appreciation of the relationship between neurovascular injury, cardiovascular disease, and senescence. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are among the smallest lesions of the cerebrum which can be visualized using MRI to indicate blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment; as such, this class of hemorrhages are important for the evaluation and macroscale detection of geriatric patients' microscale pathologies associated with neurovascular disease and/or neurodegeneration. This chapter details a streamlined protocol for MRI/CT multimodal imaging data acquisition, archiving and digital processing, including methods tailored for the analysis of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans to reveal CMB-related alterations of the human connectome. Efficient and effective MRI/CT methods like ours, when tailored for CMB and connectome analysis, are essential for future progress in this important field of scientific inquiry.

Methods: Observational and cross-sectional study with patients notified with brain death at a reference trauma center. Data were obtained through the collection of medical records and brain death declaration forms. Results: One hundred fity-nine patients were notified with brain death, mostly male (82.6%), young adults (97.61%) and victims of brain traumatic injury (93.7%). Median of the total time interval for the diagnosis of brain death was 20.75 hours, with no difference between organ donors and non-donors. We had excessive time intervals on brain death declaration, but without statistical effect on organ donation numbers. Conclusion: We had low efficacy in brain death declaration based on longer time intervals, with no impact on organ donation.

Material and Methods: Records of patients with TDI in primary teeth were included. The following parameters were registered: gender and age, place of trauma, cause of trauma, affected tissue and tooth, number of injured teeth, type of injury, and gingival and bone damage. A logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the interaction between gender and age on the occurrence of types of injuries (p <= 0.05). Results: The total of 721 records were evaluated and 370 records were included, being 61.6% boys and 60.5% children aged 0-3 years old, with 658 primary teeth affected. The support tissue was most affected (496/658), followed by dental tissue (139/658). Enamel/dentine fracture with pulp exposure (n=51) and intrusion (n=131) were the most common injuries of dental and support tissues, respectively. In general, boys suffered more traumas than girls, regardless of the age range. As for concussion, logistic regression confirms that gender and age are also influencers. Girls (OR=1.822, CI = 1.050 3.164, p=0.033) in the 4-6 year age group (OR=2.15, CI = 1.239 3.747, p=0.007) are more likely to have concussions. Children age 4-6 years were less likely to suffer an intrusion (OR=0.496; CI = 0.2780.886; p=0.018). Conclusion: Gender and age influence concussion and intrusion in the primary teeth.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation in individuals with TBI in Latin America at hospital discharge predict longitudinal trajectories of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. METHODS: A sample of 109 people with a new TBI was recruited from three hospitals: Mexico City, Mexico, Cali, Colombia and Neiva, Colombia. Participants completed measures of cognitive dysfunction and social disadaptation before hospital discharge and measures of depression at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. RESULTS: Results suggested that depression scores were found to decrease over time in a quadratic (or U-shaped) fashion, and more significant cognitive dysfunction at hospital discharge was associated with higher longitudinal depression trajectories. Social disadaptation did not exert a unique effect on depression trajectories after controlling for cognitive dysfunction. Depression trajectories changed differentially over time as a function of baseline cognitive dysfunction, such that for those with high cognitive impairment, depression scores started high and then dropped to a moderated range and plateaued, but for individuals with low cognitive dysfunction, depression scores started lower and decreased linearly but moderately. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a strong need for neuropsychological assessments and evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation strategies to be implemented immediately after TBI in Latin America, which could exert salubrious effects on depression trajectories over time.

"Punch drunk" terminology was replaced by the less derisive 'dementia pugilistica' in 1937. In the early case material, the diagnosis of dementia pugilistica required neurological deficits, including slurring dysarthria, ataxia, pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal signs, memory impairment, and personality changes, although the specific clinical substrate has assumed lesser importance in recent years with a shift in focus on molecular pathogenesis. The postmortem neuropathology of dementia pugilistica has also evolved substantially over the past 90 years, from suspected concussion-related hemorrhages to diverse structural and neurofibrillary changes to geographic tauopathy. Progressive neurodegenerative tauopathy is among the prevailing theories for disease pathogenesis currently, although this may be overly simplistic. Careful examination of historical cases reveals both misdiagnoses and a likelihood that dementia pugilistica at that time was caused by cumulative structural brain injury. More recent neuropathological studies indicate subclinical and possibly static tauopathy in some athletes and non-athletes. Indeed, it is unclear from the literature whether retired boxers reach the inflection point that tends toward progressive neurodegeneration in the manner of Alzheimer's disease due to boxing. Even among historical cases with extreme levels of exposure, progressive disease was exceptional.

Tau is an important microtubule associated protein, required for the assembly of tubulin into microtubules and maintaining structural integrity of axons. Tau has other diverse cellular functions involving signal transduction, cellular proliferation, developmental neurobiology, neuroplasticity, and synaptic activity. Alternative splicing results in tau isoforms with differing microtubule binding affinity, differing representation in pathological inclusions in certain disease states, and differing roles in developmental biology and homeostasis. Tau haplotypes confer differing susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Tau phosphorylation is a normal metabolic process, critical in controlling tau's binding to microtubules, and is ongoing within the brain at all times. Tau may be hyperphosphorylated, and may aggregate as detectable fibrillar deposits in tissues, in both aging and neurodegenerative disease. The hypothesis that p-tau is neurotoxic has prompted constructs related to isomers, low-n assembly intermediates or oligomers, and the "tau prion". Human postmortem studies have elucidated broad patterns of tauopathy, with tendencies for those patterns to differ as a function of disease phenotype. However, there is extensive overlap, not only between genuine neurodegenerative diseases, but also between aging and disease. Recent studies highlight uniqueness to pathological patterns, including a pattern attributed to repetitive head trauma, although clinical correlations have been elusive. The diagnostic process for tauopathies and neurodegenerative diseases in general is challenging in many respects, and may be particularly problematic for postmortem evaluation of former athletes and military service members.

No Evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Pathology or Increased Neurodegenerative Proteinopathy in Former Military Service Members	HANDBOOK OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION	Advances in Alzheimers Disease		English	Article; Book Chapter						Alzheimer's disease; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; tauopathy; traumatic brain injury; veterans	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HEAD-INJURY; BRAIN-INJURY; NEUROPATHOLOGIC ASSESSMENT; DEMENTIA; RISK; TAU; ASSOCIATION; FOOTBALL; PLAYERS	It is presently unknown whether military service members are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies with respect to AD have had mixed results with respect to mild TBI, although an increased risk of clinical AD with moderate and severe TBI is more consistently demonstrated. No studies to date have demonstrated a longitudinal progression from TBI to autopsy. We therefore initiated a cross-sectional survey of former military service members. 18 brain specimens have been examined to date that had extensive sampling, with an additional 64 specimens with limited sampling. The mean age was 68.4 years across all cases. Of these 82 cases, 26% were combat veterans. 13% noted a TBI history, either on active duty or in civilian life. 53% had a history of psychiatric problems, including 20% with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 17% reported neurological problems. No cases had CTE pathology. Assessment for proteinopathy by Braak staging and modified CERAD plaque scores showed averages of 2.41 and 0.78, respectively, which was essentially identical to age-matched controls (2.46 and 0.77, respectively). In the extensively sampled cases, there was no relationship between p-tau in the amygdala and psychiatric signs, including PTSD. These data suggest that military service per se is not a risk factor for CTE pathology or neurodegenerative proteinopathy. More research is needed to study the relationship, if any, between TBI and neurodegenerative proteinopathy.

Neuropathology in Consecutive Forensic Consultation Cases with a History of Remote Traumatic Brain Injury	HANDBOOK OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION	Advances in Alzheimers Disease		English	Article; Book Chapter						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta; contusion; epilepsy; neurodegenerative disease; phosphorylated tau; traumatic brain injury	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; ENCEPHALOPATHY PATHOLOGY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; UNITED-STATES; HOSPITALIZATION; OUTCOMES	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is widely assumed to be causal in neurodegenerative disease, based on epidemiological surveys demonstrating an increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) following TBI, and on recent theories surrounding repetitive head movement. We tested this assumption by evaluating 30 consecutive forensic examinations in which neuropathology consultation was sought, and in which a history of remote TBI was uncovered during the course of the investigation. In this series, there was a high frequency of psychiatric co-morbidities (100%), remote contusion (90%), and seizures (63%). Extent of proteinopathy showed no differences with age-matched controls. A subset of the cases showed focal geographic tauopathy that correlated with older age at autopsy, but had no correlation with clinical signs, and was minimal in comparison with the encephalomalacia secondary to trauma. The results suggest that cerebral contusion and post-traumatic epilepsy may be over-represented in civilian TBI, while structural brain damage from trauma is the predominant cause of morbidity following TBI.

Its most common conditions include vascular, neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory causes. Neuritis is an inflammation caused by a primary nerve injury that can progress to demyelination and even degeneration of nerve fibers. The present report aims to describe an unusual case of a female dog, German Shepherd breed, with acute manifestation of trigeminal nerve neuritis whose etiology may be associated with erlichiosis, since infection with Ehrlichia spp. through serological test was verified. Case: A 3-year-old female German Shepherd, weighing 26.8 kg and not neutered, was attended at Veterinary Hospital Dr. Halim Atique - UNIRP, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil presenting apathy, sialorrhea and polydipsia for seven days. The tutor reported an episode of foamy and yellowish vomit three days ago and ixodidiosis last week. Physical examination revealed flaccid open-mouthed posture, with mild bilateral masseter and moderate temporal muscle atrophy. Water was offered to the animal and it was observed that it could not properly seize, confirming a false polydipsia. The neurological examination revealed a slight decrease in head sensitivity, difficulty in chewing and seizure of food. It was not observed alterations in the other pairs of cranial nerves or other neurological parameters (postural reactions and spinal reflexes), and the diagnose of bilateral dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve was based on the affected neuroanatomic region. On neurological examination, other lesions of the nervous system were ruled out, suggesting an isolated manifestation of the trigeminal nerve. CBC revealed anemia, intense thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis by neutrophilia. Radiographic examination ruled out the possibility of trauma due to the absence of mandible fracture and also temporomandibular joint alterations. Masseter and temporal muscle biopsy were performed, and myositis or other masticatory muscle alterations were discarded among the diagnostic possibilities. Serological tests showed non-reactive results for toxoplasmosis and neosporosis, but reagent for Erlichia spp. Discussion: Idiopathic trigeminal neuritis (ITN) has an unknown etiology, but is not related to signs of systemic disease, and is usually not associated with deficits in other cranial nerves. The main clinical sign related to this condition is acute jaw paralysis, with inability to close the mouth, and in some cases is observed sensitivity deficits in face, as observed in the dog of this report during the neurological examination In the patient of the present report, no justifiable causes were found for the presented symptoms, except the presence of erlichiosis. The treatment was based on the use of prednisone, doxycycline, antioxidants and vitamin complex. Response to treatment was satisfactory after seven days, and complete remission of clinical signs occurred nine days after its onset. Although cranial nerve neuritis is an uncommon clinical manifestation of erlichiosis, the patient in this study presented a good response to the treatment instituted, suggesting that erlichiosis is an important differential diagnosis for neuritis.

Thus, the present study assessed the correlates of symptoms that persisted at 4 months after an ED visit and, in particular, evaluated the associations between these symptoms and self-reported stress levels at ED admission and discharge. Method: This study was a prospective observational investigation conducted in the ED of Bordeaux University Hospital that included patients admitted for minor trauma. All participants were contacted by phone 4 months after presentation at the ED to assess the occurrence of post-concussion-like symptoms (PCLS). Results: A total of 193 patients completed the follow-up assessment at 4 months; 5.2% of the participants suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 24.5% suffered from PCLS. A multivariate analysis revealed an association between PCLS and stress level at discharge from the ED (odds ratios [OR]: 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-7.40). Conclusions: The risk of PCLS at 4 months after an ED visit for a minor injury increased in association with the level of stress at discharge from the ED. These results may improve the quality of life for the millions of patients who experience a stressful injury event every year.

Helping young adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have academic potential to attend college will increase their chances of finding a good job with benefits that can pave the way for a great career and a middle-class life. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of college and university training on employment outcomes and earnings of young adults with TBI. METHODS: We conducted a non-experimental causal comparative study using propensity score matching to create a treatment (n = 278) and a comparison group (n = 278) using the RSA-911 data. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that young adults with TBI who received college or university training have better employment and earning outcomes than young adults without college or university training. CONCLUSIONS: Implications for state vocational rehabilitation counsellors are discussed.

MATERIAL and METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 11 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with infection under the skin flap after titanium mesh cranioplasty and received our new treatment between Feb 2008 and Feb 2013. We performed a 2- to 6-year follow-up to evaluate prognosis and security. RESULTS: All 11 patients were cured and discharged, and all saved their infected bone flap (titanium mesh) completely. There was no recurrence of infection after follow-up for 2-6 years. CONCLUSION: Sensitive antibiotics combined with enclosed continuous irrigation and drainage is a safe, easy, economical and effective treatment for infection after titanium mesh cranioplasty that can save the infected bone flap.

It causes premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply pipelines, increased care demand for injured elderly people, and other socio-economic burdens. This paper presents the importance of and the need for a national comprehensive TBI database that incorporates geospatial data components to help tackle the TBI epidemic. It calls for legislative and research actions to enhance the U.S. TBI data infrastructure to make the use of GIS in TBI research possible. Further, it proposes a multi-tiered conceptual framework and associated implementation strategy to establish the proposed national TBI data structure. The enhanced U.S. TBI data infrastructure will provide a feasible platform to utilize the GIS capabilities for location-based mapping, data analysis and modelling. Precision TBI research, targeted outreach, and education will likely facilitate more effective prevention and better care delivery. The enhanced U.S. TBI database infrastructure will serve as a guiding model for other developing nations. Global concerted efforts on TBI can help improve the overall quality of living around the world.

The goal of this study is to understand mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-related brain proteomic changes and tau-related biochemical adaptations that may contribute to AD-like neurodegeneration. We found that both phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and the ratio of p-tau/tau were significantly increased in brains of mice collected at 3 and 24 h after exposure to 82-kPa low-intensity open-field blast. Neurological deficits were observed in animals at 24 h and 7 days after the blast using Simple Neuroassessment of Asymmetric imPairment (SNAP) test, and axon/dendrite degeneration was revealed at 7 days by silver staining. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze brain tissue labeled with isobaric mass tags for relative protein quantification. The results from the proteomics and bioinformatic analysis illustrated the alterations of axonal and synaptic proteins in related pathways, including but not being limited to substantia nigra development, cortical cytoskeleton organization, and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, suggesting a potential axonal damage caused by blast-induced mTBI. Among altered proteins found in brains suffering blast, microtubule-associated protein 1B, stathmin, neurofilaments, actin binding proteins, myelin basic protein, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and synaptotagmin I were representative ones involved in altered pathways elicited by mTBI. Therefore, TBI induces elevated phospho-tau, a pathological feature found in brains of AD, and altered a number of neurophysiological processes, supporting the notion that blast-induced mTBI as a risk factor contributes to AD pathogenesis. LC/MS-based profiling has presented candidate target/pathways that could be explored for future therapeutic development.

FDDNP-PET Tau Brain Protein Binding Patterns in Military Personnel with Suspected Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy	HANDBOOK OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION	Advances in Alzheimers Disease		English	Article; Book Chapter						Alzheimer's disease; brain tau and amyloid; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; FDDNP-PET; mild traumatic brain injury; military personnel; retired professional football players	DISEASE; INJURY; NEUROPATHOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS	Background: Our group has shown that in vivo tau brain binding patterns from FDDNP-PET scans in retired professional football players with suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy differ from those of tau and amyloid aggregate binding observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and cognitively-intact controls. Objective: To compare these findings with those from military personnel with histories of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods: FDDNP-PET brain scans were compared among 7 military personnel and 15 retired players with mTBI histories and cognitive and/or mood symptoms, 24 AD patients, and 28 cognitively-intact controls. Nonparametric ANCOVAs with Tukey-Kramer adjusted post-hoc comparisons were used to test for significant differences in regional FDDNP binding among subject groups. Results: FDDNP brain binding was higher in military personnel compared to controls in the amygdala, midbrain, thalamus, pons, frontal and anterior and posterior cingulate regions (p <0.01-0.0001). Binding patterns in the military personnel were similar to those of the players except for the amygdala and striatum (binding higher in players; p = 0.02-0.003). Compared with the AD group, the military personnel showed higher binding in the midbrain (p = 0.0008) and pons (p = 0.002) and lower binding in the medial temporal, lateral temporal, and parietal regions (all p = 0.02). Conclusion: This first study of in vivo tau and amyloid brain signals in military personnel with histories of mTBI shows binding patterns similar to those of retired football players and distinct from the binding patterns in AD and normal aging, suggesting the potential value of FDDNP-PET for early detection and treatment monitoring in varied at-risk populations.

Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients complicated by CSW. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed on data collected from patients with TBI with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) greater than 3. Data was divided into 2 groups of patients with CSW and those without. The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse effects of CSW in regard to injury severity score (ISS), hospital length of stay (HLOS), ventilator days, ICU length of stay (ICU LOS) and survival to discharge. Data was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: A total of 310 consecutive patients with severe head injury (anatomic injury score 3 or greater) were evaluated over a 3-year period. A total of 125 of the 310 patients (40%) were diagnosed with cerebral salt wasting as defined by hyponatremia with appropriate urinary output and salt replacement. Patients with CSW had poorer outcomes in regard to ISS (21.8 vs 14.2, p<0.0001), HLOS (14.1 vs 3.5, p<0.0001), ventilator days (5.0 vs 0.45, p<0.0001), ICU LOS (8.5 vs 1.6, p<0.0001), and survival to discharge (88% vs 99%, p<0.0001). Discussion: Common adverse effects of CSW were noted in this study. Patients with TBI have a predilection towards development of CSW and consequently have poorer outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality. Data is sparse on the duration of CSW and degree of hyponatremia over time. Larger, comparative studies need to be performed to investigate the hyponatremic patient population and the clinical outcomes of those who present with CSW.

THE SEARCH FOR NEUROPROTECTIVE COMPOUNDS AMONG NEW ETHYLTHIADIAZOLE DERIVATIVES	PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; ethylthiadiazole derivatives; neuroprotection	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ISCHEMIC NEUROPATHY; OPTIC-NERVE; BIOMECHANICS	The aim of the study is to search compounds with neuroprotective properties among new ethylthiadiazole derivatives in simulated traumatic brain injury. Materials and methods. The experiment was carried out on 78 white male rats 270 +/- 20 g line "Wistar" 5-6 months of age and 120 outbred sexually mature mice weighing 20 +/- 2 grams. The article describes the search for compounds with neuroprotective properties among new ethylthiadiazole derivatives under the codes LKHT 4-15, LKHT 10-18, LKHT 11-18, and LKHT 12-18 in experimental traumatic brain injury in rats. Acute toxicity of the compounds was studied. Pharmacological screening was performed using behavioral and neurological research methods. The McGraw stroke score scale modified by I.V. Gannushkina and the mNSS psychometric scale were used in the study. The open field and Rota-rod tests were used to assess the behavioral status of the animals. Results. The compound-LKHT 12-18 at a dose of 50 mg/kg was detected as a leader. In pharmacological correction of pathology, this compound had the lowest percentage of fatality among the studied compounds (8%), the severity of neurological deficit was significantly reduced, the lowest scores and a higher level of motor activity of the limbs were registered. The number of rearing in the group of animals receiving the compound LKHT 12-18 at the dose of 50 mg/kg increased by 1.5 times, statistically significant (p<0.05) in comparison with the control group. Based on the results of the "Rota-rod" test, the total time of holding animals on the rod for 3 attempts was statistically significantly different in the groups administered with LKHT 12-18 derivatives (1.5 times longer) at the dose of 50 mg/kg compared with the control (p<0.05). Conclusion. Based on the results obtained in this study, it is planned to study in more detail the compound LKHT 12-18 at the dose of 50 mg/kg	[Cherevatenko, R.

Effect of Polyarginine Peptide R18D Following a Traumatic Brain Injury in Sprague-Dawley Rats	CURRENT THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL			English	Article						Cationic arginine-rich peptides; Diffuse axonal injury; Neuroprotection; R18D; TBI	NMDA RECEPTOR; COG1410	Background: Despite extensive studies, there are still no clinically available neuroprotective treatments for traumatic brain injury. Objectives: In previous studies we demonstrated beneficial treatment effects of polyarginine peptides R18 (18-mer of arginine; 300 nmol/kg) and R18D (18-mer of D-arginine; 1000 nmol/kg) in a rat model of impact-acceleration closed-head injury. Methods: We examined the efficacy of R18D when intravenously administered at a low (100 nmol/kg) and high (1000 nmol/kg) dose, 30 minutes after a closed-head injury in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Results: At postinjury day 3, treatment with R18D at the high dose significantly reduced axonal injury (P = 0.044), whereas the low-dose treatment of R18D showed a trend for reduced axonal injury. Following assessment in the Barnes maze, both doses of R18D treatment appeared to improve learning and memory recovery compared with vehicle treatment at postinjury days 1 and 3, albeit not to a statistically significant level. Rotarod assessment of vestibulomotor recovery did not differ between R18D and the vehicle treatment groups. Conclusions: R18D modestly decreased axonal injury only at the highest dose used but had no significant effect on functional recovery. These findings warrant further studies with additional doses to better understand peptide pharmacodynamics and provide information to guide optimal dosing.

Objective: Examine the relationship between head injury and later cognitive impairment. Methods: A sample of 3,123 Japanese-American men was assessed for history of head injury and evaluated for cognitive impairment using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). For a subsample of 676 respondents, neuropathologic results from those with and without head injury were compared. Results: Although the crude model showed an association between history of head injury and later severe cognitive impairment, the relationship lost significance in the adjusted model (OR = 1.320, CI: 0.90-1.93), regardless of time between injury and impairment Similar to cognitive impairment, hippocampal sclerosis was observed significantly more in the brains of respondents with a history of head injury in the crude model, but the relationship weakened in the adjusted model (OR = 1.462, CI: 0.68-3.12). After adjustment, decedents with a head injury demonstrated marginally higher brain weight (OR = 1.003, CI: 1.00-1.01). Conclusion: We did not find a relationship between head injury and subsequent cognitive decline in this cohort. The neuropathology results also displayed no strong association between history of head injury and specific brain lesions and characteristics. These results support other findings in prospective cohorts. However, they could be influenced by the demographic make-up of the sample (male Japanese-Americans) or by the observation that the majority reported only a single head injury.	[Chosy, E.

J	Chuaychoosakoon, C; Parinyakhup, W				Chuaychoosakoon, Chaiwat; Parinyakhup, Wachiraphan			Closed infected tibial plateau fracture and tibial tubercle avulsion: A case report	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Closed fracture; Tibial plateau; Infection	ACUTE HEMATOGENOUS OSTEOMYELITIS	INTRODUCTION: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in a closed fracture usually occurs pediatric and/or immunocompromised patients and only rarely in an immunocompetent patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 44-year-old female patient who was diagnosed as acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in a tibial plateau fracture. Following a motorcycle accident she was diagnosed as having a subdural hematoma at the right parietal lobe and combined closed fracture of the left tibial plateau and avulsion of tibial tubercle. Intraoperatively a cloudy fluid was found at the fracture site of left tibial plateau that was cultured and grew Staphylococcus aureus. The risk factors for acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in a closed fracture of this patient were the subdural hematoma and multiple abrasion wounds around her left knee. CONCLUSION: Not only open fractures have a risk of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis but closed fractures also have a chance of developing this infection. The surgeon should be concerned about this type of infection if the patient has risk factors such as evidence of head injury or multiple abrasion wounds. (C) 2020 The Author(s).
